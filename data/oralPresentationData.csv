Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137B,Fostering a Culture of Safety: Aviation Reporting System,Trenton McFarlane,1,John Anvik,Computer Science,"In the Aviation field, whether in study or in practice, creating an environment for effecient incident reporting is a very important task. The Aviation department at Central Washington University used a paper system for reporting incidents where students would need to fill out a piece of paper to report an incident and place it in a metal box in the Aviation Department office. This proved to be less than useful as many incidents were not being reported. Research showed there were many reasons this system was not used by students. Lack of privacy was the most common reason for incidents not being reported because students did not want to be seen filing a report; some students were worried about their flight instructors getting mad about incidents being reported. For these reasons, the Aviation department reached out to the Computer Science department for a new system. My team and I designed, developed, and delivered a quality and effecient system for reporting incidents with privacy. Using modern web technologies, we were able to accurately solve the Aviation departments problem and hopefully increase the number of reports being submitted."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137B,Using Time Series Models for Defect Prediction in Software Release Planning,James Tunnell,1,John Anvik,Computer Science,"To produce a high-quality software release, sufficient time should be allowed for testing and fixing defects. Otherwise, there is a risk of slip in the development schedule and/or software quality. A time series model is used to predict the number of bugs created during development. The model depends on the previous numbers of bugs created. The model also depends, in an exogenous manner, on the previous numbers of new features resolved and improvements resolved. This model structure would allow hypothetical release plans to be compared by assessing their predicted impact on testing and defect-fixing time. The VARX time series model was selected as a reasonable approach. The accuracy of the model appeared low for a single dataset, but the error was found to be normally distributed."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137B,Searching for Maximal Holes in Databases,Joseph Lemley,1,Razvan Andonie,Computer Science,"The problem of finding maximal empty rectangles in a set of points in 2D and 3D space has been well studied, and efficient algorithms exist to identify maximal rectangles in 2D space. Unfortunately, such efficiency is lacking in higher dimensions where the problem has been shown to be NP complete when the dimensions are included in the input. We compare existing methods and suggest a novel technique to discover interesting maximal empty hyper-rectangles in cases where dimensionality and input size would otherwise make analysis impractical. Applications include big data analysis, recommender systems, automatic knowledge discovery, and query optimization. "
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 201,Leadership before and after Hurricane Katrina,Philip Gohl,2,Joanne Perez,Other,"The Cross Cultural Leadership Program is a great opportunity for selected individuals to see how leadership can differentiate by cultures. Going to New Orleans, we had the privilege of talking with guest speakers who gave us an opportunity to understand the leadership of the city before and after Hurricane Katrina. Being able to compare the leadership styles of the guest speakers helped us as a cohort, understand the wide range of leadership qualities, as each speaker gave us a different perspective on their style of leading."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 201,Why Are Visitor Information Centers Important for Rural Tourism,Madalyn Freeman,2,Elizabeth Kerns,Communication,"This research study was undertaken by the Central Communication Agency, a student-run strategic communication firm at Central Washington University.  The group was comprised of four undergraduate seniors working in conjunction with the Kittitas County Chamber of Commerce Tourism Bureau.  Our goal was to find out why visitor information centers are important for rural tourism.  The group decided to move forward with a regional study on this topic and surveyed other rural Visitor Information Centers and Tourism Bureaus in Colorado, Idaho, Northern California, Oregon, and Washington State.  The students in the Central Communication Agency aggregated results and compared findings about trends and developments in the rural tourism industry.

Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 201,Your Home Matters ,Madalyn Freeman,2,Elizabeth Kerns,Communication,"The Public Relations Student Society of America hosts a yearly national public relations campaign called the Bateman Competition.  This year, over 120 teams across the nation organized and implemented a public relations campaign for Home Matters, a national movement focusing on quality, affordable housing.  The goal of the Your Home Matters campaign was to recognize the need and provision of quality, affordable housing in Kittitas County and unify local businesses to increase awareness of this local, regional, and national movement.  To fulfill this goal, our team of 5 students conducted research and held the Your Home Matters Affordable Housing Fair 2015 in our community to raise awareness on the topic of local, quality, affordable housing."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 271,Show Me The Money,Austin Neff,3,Michael Goerger,Philosophy & Religious Studies,"There are numerous ethical issues within the current structure of intercollegiate athletics. At present, one of the most hotly debated issues is the question of whether or not, in addition to their athletic scholarships, college athletes should receive financial compensation for playing in nationally televised games and having their likeness used to sell merchandise and concessions. This research investigates the issue from a philosophical perspective using an application of contractarian morality, an advanced ethical theory. Contractarianism analyzes ethical situations by viewing morality in terms of fairness of and agreeableness upon social contracts, such as the one between the NCAA and it’s athletes, to and from all parties involved. This research focuses on case studies, scholarly editorial pieces, and the disaggregation of primary source data. I will argue that college athletes who appear in nationally televised games are being undercompensated for the value they bring to their respective universities. This value is comprised mainly of monetary contributions from the sale of television packages and team merchandise but also includes benefits that are hard to quantify, such as increases in university profile. The popular argument defending the current NCAA system is that student-athletes are fairly compensated through academic scholarships and other preferential treatment. I will refute this claim. It is imperative that we address this issue from an ethical perspective so we can help the NCAA to establish future policies that preserve the sanctity of higher education and are grounded in the principles of justice and equality.

Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 271,An Argument Against Descartes's Vivid and Clear Ideas,Alysia  Rogers,3,Gary Bartlett,Philosophy & Religious Studies,"In his Third Meditation, René Descartes claims that he can know that God exists because he has a vivid and clear idea of God's existence, and that that idea is truer than any other idea he has in his mind. I will argue three different points that show that Descartes has not established a firm basis by which he can claim proof of God's existence. First, I will show how uncertain the reliability of Descartes’s understanding is in general, and also in comparison to the understanding of other competent philosophers. Second, I will argue that dreams and hallucinations could serve to bring doubt to Descartes’s vivid and clear ideas, but that preconceived notions are far more likely to have occurred with Descartes, leaving him unable to fully relinquish the beliefs of his upbringing and culture. Lastly, I will argue that Descartes seems to be operating on a scale of degrees of certainty, that this is problematic, and that it actually only makes his argument about clear and vivid ideas uncertain. Based on these three main arguments, I will show that since his beliefs about vivid and clear ideas are unreliable, doubtful, and uncertain, then these beliefs are not a solid base on which to prove any other beliefs, such as the existence of God. "
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 271,Capabilities for Central American Minors ,Sergio  Madrid ,3,Michael  Goerger ,Philosophy & Religious Studies,"Based on Martha Nussbaum's Capabilities Approach, I argue that unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras should be granted asylum in the United States. Nussbaum's approach answers a basic question: what is this person able to do and to be? A just society should create freedom and opportunities by securing capabilities for each and every individual to function at a threshold level in every way required for decent human existence. Her approach is focused on protecting areas of freedom so vital that their removal would make life unworthy of human dignity. An individual should be provided these fundamental freedoms and opportunities created by a combination of personal abilities, political, social, and economic environments. Thus, because of political corruption, increased violence, and ongoing failure to meet basic capabilities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, Central American children fleeing to the United States should be granted political asylum."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 271,An Overreaching State: How Capital Punishment Goes Beyond the Role of Government,Riley Schmit,3,Matthew Altman,Philosophy & Religious Studies,"This will be a presentation of my senior thesis in philosophy. It is a moral argument against retributivist justifications for capital punishment, which focus solely on desert (i.e., what the criminal offender deserves). I argue that although retributivism is not necessarily wrong, it cannot justify the government sentencing criminal offenders to death. It may be that certain individuals deserve to die, but this in itself is not a justification for capital punishment. I show this by first discussing the history, implications, and applications of retributivism so that the position itself is well understood before continuing. I then argue that the role of the state, regarding criminal justice, is to protect its citizens from harm and reasonable threats of harm, which can be achieved by sentencing an offender to life in prison. I show how prison is punishment in itself, and why it is the case that life in prison is sufficient punishment in lieu of the death penalty. Thus I conclude that the death penalty cannot be justified with retributivist principles because it is beyond any obligation of the government."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137A,"Rodriguez v. United States, United States Supreme Court Panel",Elizabeth Allison,6,Teresa Francis Divine,Law & Justice,"Rodriguez v. United States explores the use of drug detection dogs by police officers while conducting routine stops. It examines the citizen's interest in privacy as opposed to the benefit to police of drug detection. Rodriguez argues that his traffic stop by police was complete but was unreasonably prolonged after he denied consent to a dog sniff of his car, and that the wait for a backup officer to arrive at the scene was beyond reasonable. The state argues that the delay was short, and therefore the stop was reasonable. Since a drug detection dog is only trained to detect contraband, the invasion of privacy is minimal. This presentation examines both arguments that are before the Supreme Court of the United States and the implications for society."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137A,City of Los Angeles v. Patel,Justine Brassfield,6,Teresa  Francis-Divine,Law & Justice,"The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution was established to protect citizens from unlawful search and seizure conducted by the government. Over the years, government investigations into closely regulated businesses has been an issue argued in numerous venues. The courts have ruled that businesses such as hotels do not have an exclusive expectation of privacy because the benefit of randomly searching motel/hotel registries has helped society by fighting crimes such as prostitution and sex trafficking. There is a conflicting opinion of the Sixth and Ninth Circuit Courts of California that determines whether hotels are protected under the Fourth Amendment. In City of Los Angeles v. Patel, it will be determined whether hotels have an expectation of privacy per the Fourth Amendment by the Supreme Court of the United States. I will discuss impact of the courts’ decision whether warrantless searches of hotel registries are a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137A,Examining the Intersection of Sexual Orientation and the Right to Marry: Obergefell v. Hodge and Equal Protection,Elizabeth Sayre,6,Cody Stoddard,Law & Justice,"The legal and political climate surrounding sexual orientation and the right to marry is riddled with conflict and questions. Various states currently do not allow nor recognize marriage between same-sex couples. Hence, these couples are denied the legal privileges under the law that are guaranteed to married couples of the opposite sex.  In order to address this legal conflict, the United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on two separate questions regarding equal protection and the right of marriage: 1) are states that have same-sex marriage bans required to recognize legal marriage licenses from other states; 2) is marriage a fundamental right that should be extended to same-sex couples? This presentation will discuss the previous case law surrounding same-sex marriage, explain the legal issues at hand, discuss the implications of the courts decisions, and make a prediction of how the court will rule."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137A,Supreme Court and the Modern Death Penalty Doctrine: Hall v. Florida and the Application of the Death Penalty,Njambou  Jammeh,6,Cody Stoddard,Law & Justice,"This research will examine the Supreme Court’s decision involving the application of the death penalty in the State of Florida on the subject of the execution of an individual with intellectual disability. Precisely, I will examine the Hall v. Florida decision handed down by the Supreme Court on May 2014, in which the Judges of United States highest court constructed their decisions on an establish Supreme Court case Atkin v. Virginia . In Atkin v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that criminal defendants with mental retardation could not be sentenced to death or be executed due to the fact that such an execution would constitute cruel and unusual punishment and therefore it violates an individual’s constitutional right,  but most importantly cruel and unusual punishment was prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Using Atkins as precedent, the USSC addressed the constitutionality of Florida’s application of the death penalty when dealing with individuals with an intellectual disability. This presentation will outline in cooperation of Hall v. Florida, Atkin V. Virginia, and the role of the Supreme Court when protecting individuals with intellectual disability from the death penalty. The research will include previous case law, legal questions decided, holding and rational of the court, facts of the case, and policy implications for the area of law and as well as the criminal justice aspect."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137B,The Social Business Card,Kevin Haro,7,Holly  Johnson,Computer Science,"We present a cross platform mobile application that facilitates the distribution of personal and professional contact (i.e. business card) information. This application allows users to enter any contact 'handle' (e.g. phone email or Facebook). In addition to all of an individual's contact information being in one convenient place, users can also distribute their information to other users easily via a high performance user interface. Furthermore, users will have the ability to make multiple versions of their business card. For example, a user's social media accounts can be put into a personal card that can be distributed to friends and family. Similarly, more business oriented forms of communication can also be placed into a professional or business card and sent to potential clients. This application helps to mitigate information exchange issues such as: complex contact data transfer between individuals, outdated contact information, and non-standardized ways to present contact information. In addition to expediting the process of exchanging contact information with personal or professional individuals, this application also allows the aforementioned cards to updated dynamically as well as distributed readily to the various accounts (e.g. email, social media) of different people. This project is currently in development and facilitates the transfer of contact information via Bluetooth connectivity. This instance of the project is only being developed for the android mobile operating system at this time as development for IOS requires the use of fee-based licenses and related tools. Looking forward, our development plans include the implementation of more efficient methods to transfer data as well as development for the Apple IOS."
Feb. 24 08:30-8:50 a.m.,Room 137B,Measuring the Bias of the Media's Many Voices,Paul Williams,7,Filip Jagodzinski,Computer Science,"Breaking news is often delivered by various sources of media, but the wording used can elicit a specific response from the readers, creating bias. We have created a suite of tools for conducting media bias research. Our beta version uses an open source web spider toolkit called Scrapy to obtain the media website’s text. This web spider is implemented by custom built back-end Python and Bash scripts. These scripts generate an XML file containing the text gathered from the media websites. Our web tool calculates metrics for performing media bias analysis by use of a large library of adjectives that are rated as either positive or negative. Finally, the tool displays those metrics for the user on a web graphical user interface. Using this first version of our tool, we are able to demonstrate a ranking of the bias of the text of two media sources."
Feb. 24 10:20-10:40 a.m.,Room 137B,How Your Phone Can Make You Happy,Jennifer Thomas,7,Filip  Jagodzinski,Computer Science,"Researchers have shown that happiness is influenced by level of gratitude, a healthy amount of giving, and a more internal, rather than external, locus of control.   Current mobile phone applications meant for increasing happiness provide generic tips on how to be happier, but are not tailored to each individual user.  Our work centers on the premise that a mobile phone application can be more successful if it provides the user with recommendations based on his or her input.  We are developing android and iOS mobile phone applications that will aid in increasing the user’s happiness.   The core functionality of our mobile phone applications, which sets them apart from those already in existence, is based on a custom algorithm that incorporates the measurement of the three determinants for a user’s current level of happiness and makes suggestions of specific tasks the user could do to be happier. The algorithm is designed to output tasks that account for 27 unique happiness profiles, and also accounts for individual input, or preferences,  such as whether or not the user will visit a store that day, will be at work, or is able to purchase a gift as a part of giving to others. These suggestions are provided on a daily basis, one per day, and change accordingly based on continuing user input."
Feb. 24 10:40-11:00 a.m.,Room 137B,Modeling Humor Within Text:  Data Mining and Visualization Strategies for Automated Joke Detection,Andrew Smigaj,7,Boris Kovalerchuk,Computer Science,"The goal of this project was to investigate the use of data mining and visualization as an approach to modeling humor within text.  In particular we developed algorithmic and automated approaches to visualizing and detecting belief shifts as they occur as intelligent agents parse meaning from garden path jokes.  Garden path jokes can occur when a reader's initial interpretation of an ambiguous text turns out to be incorrect, leading them down the wrong path to a semantic dead end. Given new information semantic incongruities arise that require resolution, often triggering a humorous response. For both humans and computers parsing of meaning requires an ontology describing what type of things exist in the world and how they are connected, and methods for establishing belief given uncertainty and ambiguity.  One major aim of this project has been to explore automated methods for identifying what things exists in this world and how they are related, using the world wide web as a massive corpus of natural language data for knowledge discovery.   The methodology and tools resulting from this project offer a new approach to testing and generating hypothesis related to theories of humor, as well as many other incongruity based linguistic phenomena. "
Feb. 24 9:40-10:00 a.m.,Room 140,Geographical Analysis of Peoples' Perceptions of a Political Campaign for County Auditor,Trinity Turner,8,Elvin Delgado,Geography,"Local elections often have a greater effect on people than national elections. However, very little research in electoral geography has been done to examine small-scale local elections in the United States. This paper attempts to fill this gap and offer suggestions for further research and analysis. This paper examines peoples’ perceptions of a local political campaign in Spokane County to see if there are significant differences between rural and urban voters. The researcher used a mix of ethnographic methods to collect data during the 2014 campaign for Spokane County Auditor. Preliminary findings suggest that location was not a significant factor shaping voters’ perception, but rather their political involvement. Further research should be done in this area to gain a better understanding of the perceptions and effects of local elections and their outcomes.

Feb. 24 10:00-10:20 a.m.,Room 140,Analysis of Pollution in the Niger Delta,Chad Chambers,8,Jennifer Lipton,Geography,"Since the year of 1957, the discovery of oil in the Niger Delta became an important source of revenue for the Nigerian government. Unfortunately, this resource is being exploited and resulting in pollution. So, does recent Landsat imagery illustrate the present continuation of this pollution? Clearly, there is evidence of air and water oil pollution; it can be identified using current January 1st, 2015 data from Landsat 8 imagery paths 187, 188 and row 57. This can be done by manipulating band composites to illustrate gas flares in Short-Wave Infrared bands I & II as well as the red band; a normalized difference water index ratio (Green-NIR/Green+NIR) can also be applied to show the difference between biomass (fish populations). Thus, evaluating brightness values and spectral reflectance graphs will illustrate irrefutable evidence that large corporations such as Royal Dutch Shell are polluting both water and air in the Niger Delta; they are destroying the environment and social stability of the residents in the region by practicing unsustainable methods of extracting oil. "
Feb. 24 10:20-10:40 a.m.,Room 140,"River Channel Migration in the Teanaway Community Forest, Washington from 1954 to 2013",Alison Gray,8,Jennifer Lipton,Geography,"The purpose of this project was to analyze river channel migration in the North, Middle, and West Forks of the Teanaway River located in the Teanaway Community Forest, in north central Washington to determine the amount of change that has occurred from 1954 to 2013. Tracking this change in the Teanaway Community Forest is important to decipher what kinds of restoration can be done in the floodplain to help riparian growth. Using geographic information systems (GIS), aerial photographs from five different years were georeferenced to a National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) image of Kittitas County to account for a sixty year time period with approximately 10 years between each set of photographs. Only images where the river is present and located within the boundary of the Teanaway Community Forest were used in the georeferencing process. The river channels were then digitized from each year and compared to each time period to get an idea of migration and width changes. Areas of large change over the time period were selected and individual maps were made of each of these areas. Preliminary analysis shows that areas with small changes in river channel migration between 1954 and 1978 encountered large changes in channel migration by 2013. Knowing these areas of small and large change will help to focus restoration projects in the Community Forest."
Feb. 24 9:40-10:00 a.m.,Room 201,Brushing Up on Oral Health: Childhood Oral Health Education in Ellensburg,Lindsey Bates,9,Tishra Beeson,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","The intent of this service learning project was to develop and execute a health promotion strategy that would improve dental health behavior of 1st grade students. The objectives of our promotion were as follows; to survey existing oral health behaviors, educate on the importance of dental health, explain the effects of healthy and unhealthy snacks on dental health, teach proper brushing techniques, facilitate positive attitudes towards healthy behavior, present a fun, age appropriate curriculum, provide tools to support a sustainable change in health behavior, assess program efficacy. We met our objectives by first creating an interactive and age appropriate curriculum for the 1st grade pilot class to whom we presented (n=70). We then surveyed the pre-existing dental habits of these students by using a “heads down, hands up” method, in an attempt to eliminate peer influence on student responses. Next, we presented information on the importance of good, consistent dental habits, and healthy snacking. We demonstrated proper brushing techniques and then gave the students toothbrushes, and toothpaste and guided them through practicing the techniques they had just learned. We closed our presentation by re-surveying the students, and found that they had a significant increase in skills and knowledge. Not only did our data prove that our health promotion strategy was effective, but the fact that we were asked to come back and present to three additional classes spoke to the overall success of this presentation."
Feb. 24 10:00-10:20 a.m.,Room 201,Barriers to Breast and Cervical Cancer Screenings for Underserved Women: Results From the Health Information National Trends Survey,Janelle Wylie,9,Tishra Beeson,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","Breast and cervical cancer screenings are effective early detection measures for reducing cancer mortality among women. Following the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force guidelines, this study aims to examine the utilization of the recommended mammogram and cervical cancer screenings among subgroups of women using the Health Information National Trends (HINTS) dataset. We used the most recent iteration of the HINTS Cycle 3 survey to conduct unpaired t-tests and multiple regression models of mammogram rates among women over age 50 (n=1,105) and cervical cancer screening rates among women age 21-65 (n=1,353). It was found that nearly 1-in-4 women over age 50 did not receive the recommended mammogram, while 19% of women age 21-65 did not get the recommended cervical cancer screening. Age (p-value < 0.001, p-value <0.001), being unemployed (p-value=0.033, p-value=0.047), being uninsured (p-value <0.001, p-value <0.001), not having a regular provider (p-value <0.001, p-value <0.001), having less than a college degree (p-value <0.001, p-value=0.001) and not being married (p-value <0.001, p-value <0.001) were all associated with not receiving the recommended mammogram or cervical cancer screening, respectively. Compared to uninsured women, those who have health insurance are 1.93 times more likely to receive a mammogram (p-value=0.042) and 2.45 times more likely to receive a cervical cancer screening (p-value=0.033), when accounting for all covariates in the multivariate models. Understanding which sub-groups of women are less likely to receive essential cancer screenings will help guide public health interventions aimed at improving early detection among at-risk women. "
Feb. 24 10:20-10:40 a.m.,Room 201,Effects of taurine and chocolate milk supplementation on body composition and nitrogen excretion in triathletes,Flavia Carvalho,9,Kelly Pritchett,"Nutrition, Exercise & Health Science","Chocolate milk has been suggested to be an effective post exercise recovery beverage due to the ideal carbohydrate to protein ratio, while taurine supplementation may increase energy expenditure and favor carbohydrate metabolism. Therefore, research examining the combination of taurine with chocolate milk after exercise on insulin action in order to favor carbohydrates metabolism regulation, assist with muscle recovery, and prevent protein catabolism is warranted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of taurine and chocolate milk supplementation on body composition and nitrogen excretion in triathletes. A double-blind, crossover study was conducted with 12 male triathletes, age 25 to 35 years. 3 grams of taurine and 400ml of chocolate milk (TAUchoc), or a placebo (400 ml of chocolate milk) (CHOC) was ingested post exercise for eight weeks. A two week washout period was implemented in between trials. Body composition was measured using the deuterium labeled water method and 24 hour urinary nitrogen excretion was measured using the chemiluminescent method before and after 8 weeks of training and supplementation with TAUchoc or CHOC. An ANOVA suggested TAUchoc during the 8 weeks resulted in a significant (p= 0.029) reduction in urinary nitrogen excretion (33%), while CHOC provided significant reductions in body weight (PRE: 77.4±2.4 kg and POST: 76.5±2.3 kg, p=0.034) and body fat percentage (PRE: 17.8±1.2 % and POST: 15.5±1.5, p=0.036)  In conclusion, the addition of taurine to post exercise chocolate milk consumption prevented protein catabolism, while chocolate milk alone resulted in a more favorable body composition."
Feb. 24 10:40-11:00 a.m.,Room 201,Governmental Responsibility for Public Health: The Road Traveled and What Lies Ahead in Public Health System in China,Zhenghao Pu,9,Rex Wirth,Political Science,"In 2008 the Chinese government  launched reforms that would consolidate public heath responsibilities in a single decentralized multifunctional department. At the same time the mission of “public health” was broadened.  This new understanding is very similar to the definition used by Institute of Medicine (IOM): “fulfilling society's interest in assuring conditions in which people can be healthy” and as “organized community efforts aimed at the prevention of disease and the promotion of health.” Since these broad definitions encompass the interventions of a wide variety of public and private-sector entities in the United States, an understanding of these complex yet integrated arrangements can inform China’s reform efforts. This project is an initial mapping of arrangements in the United States that pays special attention to the institutional arrangements that effectively deal with current reform problems in China and draws some lessons from the American model."
Feb. 24 9:40-10:00 a.m.,Room 271,The New Radicals: Education and Literature for the Emancipation of Russian Women,Elizabeth Seelye,10,Roxanne Easley,History,"Russian literature of the 1860s served as a catalyst for upper-class Russian women to question the trajectory of Russian society and their place in it. Literature became one of the few outlets for young women to identify and articulate dissatisfaction with the inequality of educational options offered to them. Empowered by the literature of the 1860s that inspired women to step outside the sphere of domesticity, they become active members in the Russian revolutionary currents that were sweeping through the empire.  They demanded equal educational rights, and when that was denied, they found ways to work around the oppressive bureaucratic system that was the Russian autocracy. Literature taught women that they should no longer view themselves as lesser members of society, but as individuals who were just as capable as their male counterparts. By demanding equal access to education along with literature that was inspiring women to become active in politics, women were becoming part of the radicalism that was sweeping through the empire. "
Feb. 24 10:00-10:20 a.m.,Room 271,Preserving the Race: Gendered violence in the early conservation movement,Patience Collier,10,Brian Carroll,History,"This paper examines the ways in which the conservation movement was a response to racial and gender tensions in the late nineteenth century. In the wake of urbanization, immigration, and increasing racial diversity, there were broad cultural concerns about the decline of white masculinity as a result of the changing environment, as well as concern about the decline of femininity as the suffrage movement grew. The responding political and cultural environmental movement was split, but both sides considered strong gender roles necessary in order to encourage the health of the white race. The hyper-masculine part of the conservation movement was best represented by the “rugged manliness” philosophy of Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt equated manliness with violence, and supported the conservation of wilderness as a proving ground for white masculinity. On the other side of the movement were preservationists, who supported preserving the wilderness for its own sake. They were associated with more passive hobbies such as bird-watching, and were frequently feminized by the media, despite being led mainly by men. This gendered division had a powerful effect on the sociopolitical culture of environmentalism. "
Feb. 24 10:20-10:40 a.m.,Room 271,Friend or Foe: Foreign Diplomacy in 1861 Civil War America,Robert Moser,10,Jason Dormady,History,"At the beginning of the American Civil War, as the looming threat of succession hung over the Union, the United States government was commencing its efforts to seek out allies to aid in reuniting the nation. More importantly, they were searching for an answer to whether or not foreign aid would be provided to the Confederacy.  In 1861, the State Department began navigating the murky depths of foreign diplomacy in an attempt to ward off foreign intervention. Desperate to preserve a nation, Secretary of State William H. Seward embarked on a political journey to seek new alliances and prevent unwarranted intervention. By examining official communications from the US State Department, Seward and his deputies, dutifully crafted a narrative that sought Russia as a ally and attempted to stave off Britain from becoming an interventionist in support of the Confederacy."
Feb. 24 10:40-11:00 a.m.,Room 271,Manners of the City of Edo,Hideki Takei,10,Hideki Takei,ITAM,"The City of Edo was one of the largest cities in the world in the 18th century.  As the capital city of Japan in the Tokugawa Shogun era, Samurai was initially the dominant residence of the city.  However, as Samurai did not have ways to produce own foods and products for their life, many retailers and manufacturers in Kyoto and Osaka were invited to the city by the Tokugawa.  Soon, as the retailers bridged between Samurai and manufacturers, the retail industry became the dominant industry of the city.  As the dominance became so obvious, business manners for the retailers became general manners of the people of the city. This presentation will show examples of such manners."
Feb. 24 9:40-10:00 a.m.,Theatre,Everything is Permitted: Redesigning Ezio from Assassin's Creed 2 as a Female Character,Ashley Baker,12,Ruthi Erdman,English,"This project throws female archetypes in videogames away by turning one of the most popular male characters into a believable, playable female character. Fueled by research in history, costume design and construction, Ezio Auditore from Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: 2 is redesigned as Ezia Auditore. In this game, Ezio loses his brothers and father to a conspiracy against his family. In his acts of vengeance against his enemies, Ezio learns of the Assassin Order his father was secretly part of and their battle with the Templars. Research for this project breaks down into three parts: videogame, history, and costume. The videogame section looks into the world of the franchise. Who is Ezio? Who are the Assassins? What is his life like in Renaissance Italy? The history section focuses on the differences between the lives of men and women. What was the late 15th century like? What was life like for an Italian lady at this time? Lastly, the costume section looks specifically at how women presented themselves. What were women wearing? How did they style their hair? These pieces culminate into the final question: How will the implementation of research change Ezio, his costume, and how the game is played? Using this, Ezio turns into Ezia, a woman assassin of the Renaissance who enacts her vengeance while masquerading as a courtesan to get close to her enemies. She faces a loss in status with the loss of the men in her family, but a gain in independence as she finds freedom through the Assassins. Her costume design contains the original spirit of Ezio while embracing the fashion of Italian women in the late 15th century. The entire project culminates in a final realized costume that explores the character’s design, movement and functionality."
Feb. 24 10:00-10:20 a.m.,Theatre,Womens Roles as Tradition-bearers: Equality and Revitalization,Diane Williams,12,Tracy Andrews,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"At the very core of anthropology is the ongoing question of how cultures develop, change, and adapt. Cultural perspectives on gender roles, for example, can change based on decisions made by both men and women as the members of emigrant populations navigate ways to survive in new environments. For centuries, the contributions of Scottish women as active tradition-bearers in Scotland have often been overshadowed by a focus on the many public roles of men. Since arriving in Cape Breton Island in the mid-18th century, the culture of the original Scottish settlers has experienced significant changes relative to the political and economic changes in the larger context of the region. Previous research from the 1970s predicted the Gaelic language and culture would disappear from the island by the year 2000. My research examines the changing roles of contemporary Cape Breton Highland women (1950 – 2014) in the maintenance and transmission of Scottish culture and traditions, and challenges the assumptions of previous scholars that the language and culture are dying out. Data were collected over a seven-week period through participant-observation at cultural events, archival research at the Beaton Institute, and 13 face-to-face interviews with women of Gaelic descent. The analysis clearly indicates that, not only have women’s roles as tradition-bearers changed, but their contributions are being acknowledged and supported by the Gaelic community in the movement towards maintenance and revitalization of the language and the culture."
Feb. 24 10:20-10:40 a.m.,Theatre,How Social Factors Limit American Access to Abortion,Cheyenne Weishaar,12,Judith Hennessy,Sociology,"Female reproductive health care, primarily access to contraceptives and abortions, has been a hot topic for the past few years, and will continue to be an important issue that needs to be addressed in the United States. Though abortion has been legal since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision forty-two years ago, access to legal and safe abortions is not widespread in all states. This presentation will utilize secondary research to explore the social and cultural structures that prevent women from obtaining abortions and will analyze cultural beliefs—including religious views, and the moral beliefs surrounding the fetus—that may inhibit some women from obtaining abortions. I will also consider legislation, how it may be related to religious and moral issues, and how these can affect access to reproductive health care as well as the roles education and socioeconomic status play in women’s access to abortion. My presentation will demonstrate that abortions are not equally accessible to all women in the United States, and that social factors do limit the accessibility of this procedure. "

This session will exam how this new generation of feminism is influenced by and reflected in contemporary Young Adult Fantasy novels by authors like Tamer Pierce and Melinda Lo.  
Feb. 24 11:40-12:00 p.m.,Room 135,Adventure Girls - written story,Elsie Cziske,13,Matthew  Cziske,,"Have you ever wondered what would happen to two girls that got lost in the woods? Well you’re about to find out in a story written by two fourth grade girls, Abby Grant and Elsie Cziske called, Adventure Girls. Adventure Girls came about from a sleepover. We often get together for sleepovers as all fourth grade girls love to do! Our favorite activity to do together is write stories, and one night when looking for an activity we took our mother’s suggestion of writing a book and got started. Because we love adventures we decided we should make a story about the adventures of two friends just like ourselves. We brainstormed about what adventures they should do, what they should run into, and who their friends should be. The two main characters are Kelsey and Chelsey who are sisters and best friends. This story follows them on their adventure at school where they are confronted by bullies and become lost in the woods. The adventure really begins as they search for a way back home. Through the process of writing we have learned how to work together and develop a topic. We hope our story will inspire others to challenge themselves to become writers"
Feb. 24 12:00-12:20 p.m.,Room 135,The Illustrated Alphabet of Roman History,Pamela Stephenson,13,Michael Johnson,World Languages,"The idea to create a Latin picture book of Roman history grew out of our passion for history and our study of Augustan Latin with Dr. Johnson and our Latin study group.  The result is the book The Illustrated Alphabet of Roman History/Abecedarium Illustratus Historiae Romanorum, which provides a brief introduction to the history of Rome’s government, religion, military, and daily life.  We will be presenting a reading of the book in Latin with an English translation and accompanied by illustrations from the book."
Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Room 135,The Year of the Tortoise: Original Screenplay,Caleb Allison,13,Melissa Johnson,Film and Video Studies,"""The Year of the Tortoise"" is my most recent feature-length script, a coming-of-age comedy-drama following an angst-ridden high school student as he embarks on a turbulent quest of self-discovery in pursuit of long-sought recognition from his peers and the heart of the one girl who, he believes, makes his life worth living. This story is the amalgamation of a decade of my own personal experiences and relationships, unified by themes of personal identity, living in the moment, and finding peace in a culture obsessed with self-promotion and personal fulfillment. I will present my work as a film pitch, exploring themes, tone, settings, characters, conflict, and narrative structure, including my inspiration for the piece and culminating with a performance of one scene in the script. Prof. Melissa Johnson served as my mentor on this project, as she did for my presentation at SOURCE last year. I am indebted to her for her guidance and support, without which I would not be presenting such a complete and ""realized"" piece of my own artistic and philosophical vision this year."
Feb. 24 12:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 135,It Would Make Me Happy,Ryan Cole,13,Melissa Johnson,Film and Video Studies,"This is a short form script written for my Film and Video Studies class, where we studied not only the history of film, but the technical and cultural aspects that make filmmaking such a unique medium for storytelling. This story is about death and mortality and how we as humans cope with it. When faced with imminent death, does one cross off every item on a bucket list, or take control to remove any suspense and pain that comes with waiting? Though some would ""live like they were dying,"" some people treat death seriously and judiciously, as the next step of life for them. This short film is meant to explore the meaning of death and how it affects not only the person dying, but the people around them. This script will be performed in full by myself and three other readers. "
Feb. 24 11:40-12:00 p.m.,Room 137A,The Effects of Stigma on the Mentally Ill Students' Educational success,Melissa Weiner,14,Michael Mulcahy,Sociology,"Previous research shows that people with a mental illness (MI) diagnosis face social stigma. The social stigma of mental illness figures in analyses of the effects of MI on social networks, and a range of other outcomes, including recovery. I address this issue in the context of the postsecondary educational trajectories of students with MI. For students with MI, academic success is an important correlate of recovery. Yet we lack studies that focus explicitly on the association between the stigma of MI, social networks, and academic outcomes. When students with MI interact with professors, fellow students, and staff, such as disability services staff, the social networks formed by those interactions may reflect the stigmatized nature of their condition. My research looks at (1) the effects of MI on academic and social networks and support, and (2) the effects of these students’ social and academic networks and support on educational persistence and attainment. My research question is thus, are the negative effects of stigmatized MI on educational outcomes mediated by social and academic networks? I apply these ideas to an analysis of the Beginning Postsecondary Students (2004) dataset, a publicly available, anonymized panel dataset from interviews with beginning college students in 2003/04, again in 2005/6, and again in 2008/9. The dataset includes measures of my key independent variables – MI and academic and social integration, as well as a range of academic outcomes, from which I draw the dependent variables of my analyses."
Feb. 24 12:00-12:20 p.m.,Room 137A,A Panel Study of the Effects of World Labor Regime Integration on World Environmental Regime Integration in the 20th Century,Grant Clifton,14,Michael Mulcahy,Sociology,"The concept of the regime is often used at the international level to describe sets of rules and norms that are expected to be followed by actors (nations, corporations, etc.). Two supported world regimes, the world labor regime and world environmental regime, center around policies concerning global labor conditions and global environmental degradation, respectively. Much research examines the formation of these regimes and the effects of regime integration at the national level; however, it is not yet known whether integration in the world labor regime at the national level influences integration in the world environmental regime. Understanding patterns of integration within these regimes can be significant in understanding how countries, particularly developing countries, prioritize both labor and environmental issues. Our main research question is: “Does integration in the world labor regime predict integration in the world environmental regime?” We measure countries’ world labor regime integration (WLRI) using ratifications of international labor conventions and environmental regime integration (WERI) using ratifications of international environmental treaties. Our dataset covers the period between 1919 and 2012. We use regression methods that correct for temporal and spatial dependence in the data. Our regression analyses measure the effects of WLRI on WERI, net of controls for country-level economic and social development, and global trade. Our pending results will demonstrate whether there are any linkages between the two regimes, and whether both regimes are simultaneously sustainable by integrated members."
Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Room 137A,Racism and Sport: Occupational Segregation in International Mens and Womens Soccer,Camille Colgan,14,Nelson Pichardo,Sociology,"The studies of racism in sport have largely focused on men’s sport  (baseball, football, hockey, etc.). These studies reveal that the allocation of positions on the field of play has been governed by the underlying social construction of race. Known as the “stacking hypothesis”, it argues that those positions that are more believed to require intelligence and smarts (higher centrality) are “awarded” to Caucasians while those that require speed and quick reactions are awarded to non-Caucasians. I expand on this by applying the stacking hypothesis to a previously neglected sport- soccer- and to previously neglected population- women. The underlying research question is whether stacking is prevalent in national soccer teams and whether it is also a characteristic of women’s soccer. I will gather data at 4-year intervals (World Cup years) from 1960 through 2012 for the rosters of national men and women’s soccer teams, the race of the players as well as their positions and their win-loss records. After coding the positions in terms of centrality, I will test the proposition of whether occupational segregation by race has taken place in men and women’s international soccer teams. "
Feb. 24 12:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 137A,Student Athlete GPA & Team Success,Scott Puntenney,14,Nelson Pichardo,Sociology,A popular idea in society is that success of a collegiate sport team is based on the recruitment of players that have marginal academic qualifications. I would like to examine this proposition by investigating whether the grade point averages of the student-athletes is correlated with the performance (win-loss record) of the team. Collecting data from schools participating in the Pacific 12 (PAC-12) and the Greater Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) football programs will also allow for a comparison across types of football programs (Div. I vs. Div. II).  Data collected will be in the form of unidentifiable and anonymous GPA’s of the 110 man rosters of the twelve teams in the Pac-12 and the seven teams in the GNAC.  Once collected the data will be analyzed to determine if those teams with higher average GPA’s are more likely to have higher or lower win percentages as an overall team. 
Feb. 24 11:40-12:00 p.m.,Room 137B,Web-tool Design for the Sciences,Branndon Edwards,15,Filip Jagodzinski,Computer Science,"When performing research in any given field often times the use of custom-built software is employed in order to facilitate a more expedient research process. Users of these programs are most often not computer specialists themselves and experience difficulty utilizing the software. We are developing a front-end platform that is capable of interfacing with back-end programs hosted on a server. The infrastructure integrates web development technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP), shell scripts utilizing gnuplot, and a locally hosted server. The HTML web-page invokes the scientific software, which has been reviewed and debugged for efficiency and run-time errors, before utilizing a shell script to generate statistical plots of functions. This script parses the hosted scientific software’s output and formats the data for gnuplot to extrapolate. The statistical and graphical plots are posted to the website’s front-end graphical user interface for the end user to analyze. This platform is currently being tested by implementing software that is in development by Elizabeth Brooks for biology (co)variance research at Central Washington University.

Feb. 24 12:00-12:20 p.m.,Room 137B,Object-Oriented Implementation of a Novel Mathematical Framework to Determine the Effects of Developmental Interactions on Evolutionary Responses,Elizabeth Brooks,15,Filip Jagodzinski,Computer Science,"Quantitative genetics is the study of complex biological traits, or traits controlled by more than one gene. Traditional quantitative genetic models use the (co)variances of traits to predict evolution in response to selection. However, traits often result from nonlinear interactions between developmental factors. Because of this, traditional models may not accurately predict evolutionary dynamics. With an updated mathematical framework, we have developed a program that will determine the extent to which the developmental architecture of traits affects the evolutionary response of a given species. To date, we have developed an object-oriented program in Java as well as C++ that is highly adaptable, easily permitting future extensions to the code base. The program’s infrastructure allows for increasingly complex levels of developmental interaction through the incorporation of a class hierarchy that refines and increases the flexibility of the code. This programming structure will readily interface with a web-based tool that accepts user supplied functions for particular biological systems that can then be seamlessly integrated into the source code. The completed program will allow users to test hypotheses about how the developmental interactions among multiple traits affect their (co)variances and subsequent evolutionary trajectories."
Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Room 137B,Investigating Rigidity Properties and Atomic Content of Proteins,Christian Walling,15,Filip Jagodzinski,Computer Science,"Proteins are three dimensional molecules that bend and flex to perform a multitude of functions, ranging from cellular repair, to mediating the immune response, to aiding in neuronal signal propagation. Drugs are designed to regulate protein functions and their interactions, which they do by closely associating with cavities or other structurally important features on a protein’s surface. Because the properties of protein cavities have not been analyzed in a dataset large enough, it is unclear how, or to what extent, the geometric properties and atomic content of a cavity play in facilitating a protein’s interaction with other molecules. Analyzing the rigidity properties and atomic content of protein cavities from a large database would allow development towards a deeper understanding of how proteins interact with other molecules. Preliminary results from a dataset of about 20,000 cavities have already indicated a dominant region for cavity size and the number of rigid clusters within. For our work, we are trying to determine if the molecular content of rigid bodies within cavities can be used to distinguish them from other proteins by using metrics gathered on the size of cavity, the number of atoms in the cavity, and the types of those atoms. To accomplish this, we have created a series of custom BASH scripts to calculate metrics based on information gathered from calculated cavity data and the biological data of the protein. "
Feb. 24 12:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 137B,Image Classification with Approximately Biologically Realistic Elements,Sami Abdul-Wahid,15,Razvan Andonie,Computer Science,"Image classification is a well studied problem, with applications such as face recognition and natural image classification. Here image classification is done using a neural network of spiking neurons in a feedforward heirarchy that resembles certain structures of the visual cortex. Image encoding is done first through edge detection on the image, after which an HMAX model is used to bring about degrees of scale, position, rotation, and contrast-reverse invariance. Then, a single spiking neural network layer is trained to classify the encoded image using supervised learning. Results are shown for classification of single digit handwritten numbers."
Feb. 24 11:40-12:00 p.m.,Room 140,Far-Infrared Laser Emissions of Optically Pumped Methanol Isotopologues,Michael Smith,16,Michael Jackson,Physics,"Historically, a rigorous study of the far-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has been difficult due to a lack of sensitive detectors and powerful sources in this region. However, technological advances in the past several decades, such as the optically pumped molecular laser, have provided invaluable tools which allow us to better explore the far-infrared region (informally defined for wavelengths between 0.025 mm and 2 mm). Studies of the far-infrared region using the optically pumped molecular laser could prove invaluable for many areas of science. For instance, these lasers can be used in high resolution spectroscopic investigations whereby researchers study the fundamental interaction between light and matter. At Central Washington University this past summer, an optically pumped molecular laser system was used to generate laser radiation in the far-infrared region. Using heterodyne, or frequency mixing techniques, the frequencies of over 80 far-infrared laser emissions have been measured using methanol isotopologues as a lasing medium. This presentation will focus on providing an overview of the experimental system along with the methodology used for measuring far-infrared laser frequencies.  Several examples of frequencies measured for the CD<sub>3<\sub>OH, CH<sub>3<\sub>OD, and CHD<sub>2<\sub>OH methanol isotopologues will also be provided."
Feb. 24 12:00-12:20 p.m.,Room 140,Measuring Far-Infrared Laser Frequencies from Optically Pumped CH<sub>3<\sub><sup>18<\sup>OH,Clarissa Gerke,16,Michael Jackson,Physics,"Far-infrared radiation (defined as having wavelengths from approximately 0.025 mm to 2 mm) has applications in many disciplines including astronomy and spectroscopy. These advances and subsequent applications have become possible through the research performed with far-infrared lasers that includes the discovery and classification of viable far-infrared emissions from various lasing media. Over the last few years, undergraduate students at Central Washington University have used a recently constructed optically pumped molecular laser system to generate over 600 far-infrared laser emissions, about half of which have been measured solely by wavelength. Last year, this optically pumped molecular laser system was incorporated into a heterodyne, or frequency mixing, system consisting of two additional carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\sub>) reference lasers and their respective stabilization systems.  With this heterodyne system, the laser emissions generated by a number of different laser media have been further characterized by measuring their frequency. This presentation will focus on the process of using the heterodyne system to search for and measure far-infrared laser frequencies, as well as how these frequencies are used in the spectroscopic assignment of far-infrared laser emissions as applied to the CH<sub>3<\sub><sup>18<\sup>OH methanol isotopologue."
Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Room 140,Constraining The Uplift History Of The Transantarctic Mountains With Apatite Fission Tracks,Teo Fisher,16,Audrey Huerta,Geological Sciences,"The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) span approximately 3,000 km and stand 3-4 km high but their origin is not well understood. There are several competing theories regarding the origin of the TAM. One theory, rift flank uplift, involves one side of a fault rising and being eroded. Another theory, plateau collapse, involves the rifting (pulling apart) and collapse of a plateau with a remnant margin forming the TAM. The exhumation (uplift and erosion) history of the TAM is recorded in the mineral apatite. Apatite fission track (AFT) data allows us to see the duration and rate of exhumation starting at a depth of about 4 km below the surface. Decades of work in the TAM by researchers has produced an abundance of AFT data. In this study, AFT data in the TAM were compiled and plotted in ArcGIS along with geological maps and digital elevation models for analysis. The AFT data was analyzed in fault blocks segmented by major faults perpendicular to the coast. AFT data of the TAM were plotted with elevation and distance from the coastline of the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf to evaluate the overall trend of each fault block in relation to the coastline. Preliminary results show more exhumation near the coastline which decreases inland and with elevation and appear to accommodate the plateau collapse model."
Feb. 24 12:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 140,"The Role of Magma Mixing in the 1968-2010 Eruption of Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica: Insights from Modelling of the Magma Chamber",Jenna Adams,16,Wendy Bohrson,Geological Sciences,"Magmatic processes, such as magma mixing (mixing of 2 or more magmas), control compositional diversity of magmas (less to more silica-rich), eruption style (gentle to explosive) and can potentially catalyze eruptions, making documentation of mixing events at active volcanoes important for improving eruption prediction. Thousands of cases of magma mixing have been documented, but a new computational approach documents for the first time the relative size, frequency, and location beneath the volcano of mixing events. The 1968-2010 eruption of Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica produced lava flows that are homogenous at the whole-rock (kg) scale but highly heterogeneous at the crystal (mg) scale. The hypothesis of Streck et al. (2005) that four distinct magmatic components mixed in a shallow subvolcanic magma reservoir to produce Arenal’s lavas was analyzed by the Magma Chamber Simulator, a new thermodynamic computer model (Bohrson et al., 2014). Based on several hundred simulations, model results constrain pre-mixing pressure, oxygen fugacity, temperature, and H2O contents of the four crystallization environments. Three reside 3-6 km below the surface and magmas are relatively oxidized (QFM to QFM+1) with moderate water concentrations (2-3.5 wt.%). The fourth is ~23 km below the surface with crystallization requiring oxidizing conditions (QFM+1) and H2O contents of 3-4 wt.%. Mixing simulations that best reproduce observed temperatures and lava and crystal compositions require high frequency, small volume intrusions that mix into a shallow subvolcanic magma chamber. Quantification of the size and frequency of mixing events should improve our understanding of eruption precursors, thereby improving volcanic hazard prediction. "
Feb. 24 12:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 201,A Statistical Analysis of Sunflower Growth,Ashley Gowdey,17,Dominic Klyve,Mathematics,"This study considers whether the date at which a maternal sunflower begins to flower has a significant impact on the sunflowers grown from its seeds.  The data was collected by Dr. Jenny Dechaine of the Department of Biology. She ran an experiment which began with one population of sunflowers. From there, seeds were taken from those flowers in order in which they flowered. Seeds taken from the sunflowers that flowered first became seed group A. Seeds from the next flowering group became seed group B, and so on until seed group H. The purpose of the experiment was to test if there was any relationship between when a seed's maternal plant flowered and a variety of measurements. Data on over 100 sunflowers were collected, recording such information as the number of leaves a plant had, the lengths of the leaves, and whether or not there was a presence of downy mildew. I preformed the analysis of the dataset to find any significant differences in the groups of sunflowers. I provide descriptive statistics of each variable, as well as some combinations of seed groups, to better test if there was a significant difference between seeds with maternal plants that flowered early and those with maternal plants that flowered later."
Feb. 24 11:40-12:00 p.m.,Room 201,Statistical Analysis of Tibetan Macaques (Macaca thibetana) Maternal Offspring Investment,Carter Wallace,17,Dominic Klyve,Mathematics,"As with most species, maternal investment in offspring is vital to Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana). Females typically first begin breeding around five years of age, give birth to a single offspring with each pregnancy, and have a gestational period of six months. Data was collected on macaque females to compare the amount of effort mothers invest in their offspring over the course of their life. Measurements of investment were taken based on the amount of time the mother spent grooming, carrying, and proximate to her offspring. Focal animal samples were taken, lasting five to ten minutes each day, with the mothers being sampled in random sequence. Statistical analysis was run to examine and compare differences between measurements over the macaque lifetime."
Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Room 201,Stock Analysis of Hasbro,Alex  Wold,17,Thomas Tenerelli,Finance & Supply Chain Management,"The purpose of the current study was to quantitative analyze the toy making company Hasbro's prospects to come up with an investment rating. Utilizing only publically available information such as news reports, known competitors actions and income statements to create a basis of understanding for the company. The next step is to go deeper and use the obtained information to approximate Hasbro's market share in each of its subsidiaries and estimate any possible growth potential.  This leads to a rough valuation of the company in terms of dollars. The final piece of our analysis will be an examination of some other reports. Have professional analysts changed their recommendation recently? Has management been buying a bigger stake in the company? Either of these could mean the stock price is expected to change soon. A quantitative analysis of the company earnings moving forward will allow us to calculate an estimated future price per share of the company.  Resulting ultimately in a researched recommendation to buy, sell, or hold the stock based on our in depth research."
Feb. 24 12:00-12:20 p.m.,Room 201,Constant Vector Curvature in Three Dimensions,Albany Thompson,17,James Bisgard,Mathematics,"Differential geometry is the use of the techniques and tools of calculus to study the geometric properties of manifolds. One of the most commonly studied properties of manifolds is their curvature. We can measure the curvature of a manifold at a point by using a metric called an algebraic curvature tensor and a geometric object known as a model space. A model space is formed when a manifold, inner product, and algebraic curvature tensor are grouped together. There are several curvature conditions that a model space can satisfy. This research is concerned with the necessary and sufficient conditions for a model space in three dimensions with positive definite inner product to have the specific curvature condition of constant vector curvature. This presentation summarizes the background for this research along with its findings."
Feb. 24 11:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 271,Beyond the Eyes of the Dominant:  Reciprocity and Peace-building on the Street,Saeed Mohamed,18,Mark Auslander,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Low-income African immigrant young men in U.S. metropolitan areas are subjected to police surveillance as well as stereotypical media representations, which emphasize violence, drug abuse, and criminality. In my fieldwork with youth in a major Pacific Northwest city, I studied the ways in which this dominant gaze is both internalized and redirected. This paper concentrates on one nighttime ethnographic incident, in which a potential gunfight between two groups of young men was narrowly averted through replacing one form of negative exchange with a positive exchange action. In this social drama, an escalation of insults led to the ominous brandishing of weapons. At a critical moment, one of the principal’s attention was reoriented through the gift of marijuana, reminding him of bonds of fictive kinship with his companions and pacifying the situation. When can such gift economies co-exist with, or overcome, hegemonic structures of power and violence? "
Feb. 24 11:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 271,The Body as a Battlefield of Resistance:  Cracking the Skulls of the System in a Polynesian Performance.,Patrick Molohon,18,Lene Pedersen,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Through the analysis of a Marquesan haka performance in a touristic setting in Tahiti, this paper explores the notion of the Polynesian body as a site of struggle between the gaze and premonitions of cosmopolitan French tourists of the exotic other, and the resistance and self-interiorizing of the body by Marquesans. Many contemporary Marquesans choose to migrate to the more urbanized, popular tourist destination of Tahiti, for work, schooling, and medical procedures. Removed from their native land, Marquesans still build upon traditional cultural practices and worldviews, while simultaneously actively creating innovative aspects of their experience in the new setting. My analysis is based on stories of how tourist performances create and affirm Marquesan culture, gathered through ethnographic research, participant observation and interviews in August, 2014, Pape’ete, Tahiti. How does the body, prone to commoditizing processes within the tourist system, also emerge as a site of moral economy, community empowerment, and generalized reciprocity? "
Feb. 24 11:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 271,Bonds of Blood: Vampire the Masquerade as Urban Heterotopia,Nicolas Crosby,18,Hope Amason,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"This presentation explores the Live Action Role Playing game ""Vampire the Masquerade"" (VtM) through Foucault's concept of the heterotopia, with special attention to the complex symbolic politics of blood and the family in modern American culture.  Although, at times dismissed as a frivolous “game,” VtM is taken seriously by its participants.  Masqueraders have transitioned, within a microcosm, from hegemonic American notions of family into a completely different sort of family unit, which emerges from in-game dynamics.  Due to a desire to be a part of something larger in scope, with stronger bonds, they have joined a system which allows them to have two families.  While they may maintain their nuclear, “real” family ties, they have also joined themselves to another “family,” which I show to take shape in the form of a lineage with a long, documented, and noble history.  These double lives tend to express themselves most frequently within urban environments, where societal bonds tend to weaken or disappear— as opposed to smaller towns, and villages where bonds tend to last longer, and be more defined.  In order to create new bonds and status hierarchies within the metropolis, the game is conducted in the “real world” and in a mythic cityscape.  While the players may project their own society onto the cityscape, the city’s physical geography is always present underneath, in multilayered inversions.  Thus, the heterotopia of the Masquerade is simultaneously produced and transmuted each night."

These buskers work for tips on crowded sidewalks adjacent to corporate entertainment venues. This ethnographic study explores how buskers in the Gaslamp forge alliances with those they share the streets with, including night club promoters, bouncers, passersby and cab drivers. These alliances are both actively sought out and inactively acquired. Through participant observation, direct observation, and interviews, I explored how gifting and creating networks of trust can help buskers manage risk and earn respect. How do buskers benefit from alliances formed within this corporate controlled environment, yet still maintain their independence from it?"
Feb. 24 11:40-1:00 p.m.,Room 271,"Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect: The Moral Economy of Rave Culture",Brittany Anderson Anderson,18,Hope Amason,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Each year tens of thousands of individuals travel great distances to the largest rave event in the Pacific Northwest, located at an outdoor arena in Washington State. Social expectations at rave events such as this are forged by the rave values of peace, love, unity and respect, referred to by ravers as PLUR.  Ravers promote PLUR through the sharing of drugs, alcohol, kandi bracelets, and costumes. This presentation analyzes fieldwork from this rave in order to contemplate apparent contradictions within rave culture that are fostered when the moral economy of PLUR meets conspicuous consumption. Ravers strive for an economy outside market forces while at the same time reinforcing market economy through ticket sales, camping supplies, costumes, and original payments made for bartering material.  How do participants at raves practice solidarity yet remain individual and how are these two positions reflected in moral obligations and economy?"
Feb. 24 11:40-12:00 p.m.,Ballroom A,Site Specific Project,Katelyn White,19,Crystal Fullmer,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","This work is from the choreography class in which I had to create and perform a movement phrase in a location on campus. Creating this project really challenged me as a choreographer because we had to learn to work with objects in the environment while using at least five compositional devices. Growing up a dancer, there was always music to dance with, however in this project we had to use the background noise of our location as accompaniment. There is no meaning behind this dance; when I chose my site, near the green house facing D Street, I was trying to imagine movement that would compliment the trees, the bench, or the light pole. There were some aspects that were almost overwhelming because I had so many options in the space with which to work. One thing that helped me create this dance was focusing on the fun aspects. When I am told what I need to create I get stressed, but remembering simple things like playing in the park as a child really helped me. I focused on accumulation, dynamic variation, active stillness, and acceleration and began to have fun with simple movements, such as running from a tree to the light pole and spinning around. At one point I sat down on a bench and began to play and from there I was able to complete my dance."
Feb. 24 12:00-12:20 p.m.,Ballroom A,Only in Memory,Quinci Daoust,19,Crystal Fullmer,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","I choreographed <i>Only in Memory</i> for my final project in the choreography course. I wanted to create a humorous dance with movement inspired by animals, and it was at this time my dog lost her sight. There is no music because I was inspired by the sound scores of John Cage, an unorthodox, American composer. The final project in this course required that we choose a work of visual art and a poem as inspiration for our choreography. The poem I chose is called, <i>Running with Blind Dog</i> by Brian Demay. I discovered this poem while researching blindness. Lastly, my visual inspiration is a picture of a dog named Iggy. He is a Boston terrier with a glazed look in his eyes and drool dripping down his flat face. I found this picture to be amusing and weird, just as dogs can be. The picture was created by Araki Hirohiko, a Japanese artist, for the manga series titled, <i>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure.</i> I had a Boston terrier for a long time and am familiar with how they move and act. I had no difficulty finding a dancer willing to be as energetic as a puppy, but the challenging part was in making the dancer appear to be blind. I want my dance to bring laughter and pity from those who watch it, while conveying the excitement that dogs hold for life even when misfortune has blinded them."
Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Ballroom A,Site Specific Project,Marie Turner,19,Crystal Fullmer,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","I created this work in the choreography class of fall 2014. For this project we had to find a location on campus and create a dance phrase of 1-2 minutes, in which the movement strongly correlates with the geography. Music was not used in the project and this made the choreographic process interesting because the atmosphere changed each day. I chose a bridge as my site which presented its own challenges. With people walking by, cars driving in the background and ducks quacking, they unintentionally became part of my choreography. Throughout the creative process I used many compositional devices and choreographic tools to create a cohesive dance. Using Rudolf Laban’s Basic Efforts as guidelines helped me focus on the actions of pressing, slashing, flicking, gliding and wringing. I found the compositional devices to be the most useful in this project in which we needed to use a minimum of six devices out of the ten we learned. I chose to focus on using repetition, acceleration/deceleration, accumulation, retrograde, active stillness and dynamic variation. Not having music and using the different efforts and devices was a new method of creating dance for me. I discovered new potential for movement invention because I was not tied to music. Overall I learned how important movement is by itself because people are given the freedom to interpret the dance without the help of music to give them the story."
Feb. 24 12:40-1:00 p.m.,Ballroom A,Dualities,Marie Turner,19,Therese Young,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","This piece was created in Orchesis during fall quarter and will be a part of the annual Orchesis end of the year dance performance. This piece began as a series of movements that I gradually put together to create a long unified movement. I found the song “Breathe Me” by Sia and decided to use this for my choreography because the music accented the movements perfectly. I originally planned on having 6 dancers but came to a final decision of 8. An even number was essential for this piece because the dance is based on finding yourself and fighting between who you are and who you want to be. The pathway to finding oneself can be difficult and can sometimes lead you in many directions, which is why I decided to name this piece “Dualities.” Throughout this dance there is a lot of partnering or movements that are soft and fluid while other movements are fast and strong to show the conflicting feelings people go through when finding their way through life. The dance starts off slow and peaceful and gradually becomes more chaotic and conflicting. Towards the end the dance, the movements slow down again as some dancers run or slowly walk off stage to show different ways of coping with change within oneself. The dance ends with the last two dancers facing each other to show that it is possible to overcome obstacles and find your true self."

Dale Drummond thinks he finally caught the missing piece connecting Bud to the crimes. Only, he discovers Mrs. Blanche has been the crime lord the whole time and Bud playing the pawn. “Pit of Greed” was created by the very stellar Central Washington University Motion Picture Club consisting of extremely motivated and passionate filmmakers. We put this film together for the film and video studies 48hr film slam competition. We were give only 48hrs to put a film together consisting of writing, casting, filming, and editing. With such a short time span, there were many issues ranging from equipment failure to cranky individuals. But the most devastating issue of the whole project was the audio. The audio in “Pit of Greed” had been neglected and needed to be fixed. It took many hours dedicated to post-production to fully clean up the audio. Even under such a tight deadline, the film was finished and went on to win best directing. You can see the film here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlEb5k3XKzA.

Feb. 24 12:20-12:40 p.m.,Theatre,Film and Video Studies Promonal Video,Eric Durkopp,20,Jon Ward,Film and Video Studies,"The film and video studies program at Central Washington University has grown immensely since its creation in 2008. Since then, the program has gone on to graduate numerous majors studying in critical studies or production specializations. The program has upgraded its equipment to allow near Hollywood level productions and signed on new faculty members to feed the growing need of the students studying the major. Through all these fantastic improvements and upgrades there was one element lacking, a new promotional video. The old promotional video for the film and video studies program was very dated (created in 2008) and lacked many of the higher production values the program could now achieve. It could not effectively promote the program as it stands today. So in Jon Ward’s Corporate Media Production class, Nick Titus and I (Eric Durkopp) were chosen to create a new promotional video. We knew this promotional video had to demonstrate the program’s maturity in teaching the practical and theoretical, but also exhibit its capacity of high production filming at the same time. Achieving such a level was not an easy task and would require a balancing act to keep it all together. In the end, we believe we found that balance from our countless interviews of faculty and students alike. The film and video studies promotional video represents the program as a whole. It demonstrates what prospective students will receive if they choose to study at Central Washington University Film and Video Studies. "

Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Room 135,Persuasive Processes: Acknowledging Student Agency in Assignment Prompts,Peter  Rampa,21,Josh Welsh,English,"It's easy to overlook the persuasive strategies used in board game instructions. An instruction sheet serves so many practical purposes, after all, that something like clarity might seem a more immediate and sensible metric for assessment. The same is true of assignment sheets in the post-secondary academic setting. Like board game instructions, assignment sheets outline a process for an intended audience to complete. Easy-to-follow instructions are great. Dense instructions are a chore. But the language of board game instructions and assignment sheets can sustain a more critical approach. What are the implicit arguments made by instruction sheets and the processes they describe? Are those arguments rhetorically persuasive? Are the intended audiences addressed as static participants or individuals with agency? Through a rhetorical analysis of Trivial Pursuit board game instructions, this project presents a practical schema for persuasive process design in academic assignment sheets. A key aspect of persuasive process design, particularly in the pedagogical context, is the acknowledgment of student agency. That is, the opportunity for intellectual curiosity and self-directed learning. I argue that the traditional language of assignment sheets often communicate restrictive processes that subordinate participants and therefore inhibit student agency. Early Trivial Pursuit instructions exhibit similar shortcomings. However, due to its reliance on pop culture, Trivial Pursuit has had to continuously revise instruction sheets in order to persuade contemporary audiences. I explore the persuasive strategies used in 30 years’ worth of Trivial Pursuit instructions, and consider how this history might inform the design of academic assignment prompts.

Feb. 24 1:30-1:50 p.m.,Room 135,"Snicker, Snap, and Mutter: A Corpus Survey of Sarcasm in Fiction",Camille  Bello,21,Loretta  Gray,English,"This study aims to determine how sarcasm is communicated in written discourse.  Writing sarcastically is challenging for essentially two reasons: loss of paralinguistic cues, such as behavior and intonation, as a marker, and because sarcasm has no standard grammaticalized form.   Sarcasm is differentiated from irony.  To gather data, a search string was conducted on COCA using the word sarcastically in the category of fiction.  A total of 287 items resulted from the search. The hypothesis was that in addition to the use of the word sarcastically, there would also be additional lexical information present used to convey sarcasm.  It is this information that was analyzed.  Lexical items from this search string were found to fit into nine categories of the proposed quasi-tense “the sarcastive” by author John Haimen, a leading researcher on the topic of sarcasm.  The categories, or sarcasm cues, are as follows: hyperbole, sneers and laughter (out of Context) ironic repetition of fresh talk, flattening, enantiosemantic phrases, hyperformality/register, manner of speaking verbs, repetition, and syntacticization.  It was found that hyperbole was the most frequent cue for sarcasm, followed by flattening, manner of speaking verbs, enantiosemantic phrases, hyperformality, repetition, sneers and laughter (out of context), ironic repetition of fresh talk, and lastly syntacticization.  After a review of the literature, it became quite clear that the study of the pragmatic field of sarcasm is one that is emerging, but that is particularly lacking in clear standards and definitions; conflicting information abounds.

As the son of an Archdeacon of the Church of England and a Fellow at Christ Church College, Oxford, Carroll was very familiar with both religion and education. By parodying various popular religious forms, figures, and texts and associating these with the nonsense of Wonderland, he effectively offers an alternative to the standard, rote forms that dominated nearly all aspects of Victorian education."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 135,Like Something Out of Stephen King,T.J. Tranchell,21,Liahna Armstrong,English,"In the world of popular American literature, there is arguably no authorial name bigger than Stephen King. Since the release of his first novel Carrie in 1974, there has rarely been a year without a new King book and invariably these books reach the bestseller lists. But Stephen King has not always been a household name. He has not always been America’s boogeyman. In this paper, I will seek to discover how Stephen King became Stephen King. More than just an author, King has become a brand, a subgenre unto himself. King can also be read as text. Like the work he has produced, King is wrought with connections: from text-to-text and author-to-text. King is not only self-referential within works bearing his name, but has referenced himself in books published under a pseudonym, and has even become a character. Like Michel Foucault, I will not be “examining how the author became individualized in a culture like ours…” but rather exploring “the relationship between text and author and with the manner in which the text points to this ‘figure’ that, at least in appearance, is outside it and antecedes it.” "
Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Room 137A,College Students' Perception of Rape,Laura Gutierrez,22,Marte Fallshore,Psychology,College students are the biggest population that experiences rape situations and has the biggest population that accepts and endorses rape myths overall. The purpose of this study was to ask college students their perceptions of rape depending on the gender of the perpetrator and whether or not the victim (who is under the influence of alcohol) repeatedly says “no” to the perpetrator. Participants rated the severity of the assault and had the option of saying the assault was not a crime in order to investigate whether college students realize that having sex with an intoxicated person is rape even if they don’t say no. The results demonstrated that the rape involving a female victim was rated more severely than when the rape victim was a male. The results also demonstrated that when the intoxicated victim said “no” the rape scenario was rated more severely than when the intoxicated victim said nothing. Implications of these results are discussed.

The findings show the strongest motivating factor for both these groups was that of enjoyment. Health ranked high for both groups. Competition as motivation ranked high for the CA and was not significant for the NCF group. The motivation of stress management ranked evenly across both groups. Social recognition ranked lowest in both groups with the NCF group displaying the lowest score. The number of participants for this present research was 103.

Participants in this program were military servicemen and -women stationed at Joint Base Lewis McChord. Many of these participants were recruited by their occupational and other military therapists; other participants were recruited directly by Rainier Therapeutic Riding via word-of-mouth and promotional materials. All direct identifiers will be removed from this archival data; participants’ responses and general rider category will remain completely anonymous. Several hundred individuals have participated in this program, to date. The therapeutic horsemanship program, itself, entails eight weekly sessions wherein the military servicemen and -women interact with, and eventually ride, one horse with which they develop a relationship focused on mutual trust. A PATH-certified instructor, in compliance with PATH procedures and guidelines for safe and effective therapeutic horsemanship facilitation, guides each participant through his or her weekly protocol. For analytical purposes, the participants will be divided based upon their general rider category: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Any specific medical information, including specific clinical diagnoses (e.g., DSM 5 or ICD10) given by medical personnel will not be included in the archival data set provided to this researcher. Variables such as self-reported general anxiety, mood, and physical pain (as measured by three simple Likert scales) will be compared both before and after each therapeutic horsemanship session, and between participants in the two rider categories."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 137A,The Effects of Detail and Valence on False Beliefs in Lies ,Danielle Polage,22,Danielle Polage,Psychology,"This study examined the effects of lying on the liar’s memory for the truth. Participants filled out a Life Events Inventory that asked them to rate the likelihood that various events had happened to them before age 10. Participants were interviewed by the experimenter and prompted to either lie or tell the truth about several positive and negative valence events. Participants were told to claim an event was true when prompted with the question “Tell me about the time you…” and to deny an event when prompted with the question “How do you know you never…?”.  Participants lied by claiming non-experienced events had happened to them.  During the interview participants created narratives about the events and attempted to convince the experimenter that their stories were true.  Half of the participants were asked follow-up questions asking for additional details of the event.  Participants later filled out a second Life Events Inventory online and the change score between the pre- and post- lie manipulation was calculated. The results showed that participants inflated their belief in the lied about events as compared to controls.  Overall there was no effect of valence; however, there was a significant interaction between valence and level of detail elicited, in that positive detailed lies and negative lies without details were more likely to be believed.   These results demonstrate that lying can influence memory for the truth and that providing details differentially affects participants’ memories for positive and negative lies. The potential application of these results will be discussed."
Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Room 137B,Will Improved Assembly Approaches Lead to Improved Biological Inferences?,Olivia Kleyn,23,Linda Raubeson,Biological Sciences,"The ability to determine the DNA sequences of genomes has provided an excellent source of data for biological studies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, have expanded our ability to determine genome sequences as they are relatively inexpensive; however they are potentially less accurate due to the read length being shorter than in first generation techniques, giving a higher probability of incorrect assemblies. The short NGS reads must be assembled into genome sequences and computer programs to do this work are improving all the time. The goal of my work is to analyze the impact of those changes on chloroplast genome assembly and see if they can lead to improved biological inferences. To do this we compared chloroplast assemblies of genomes from NGS data for six species within Araucariaceae: Wenbin Mei analyzed these data using the assembly methods available in 2010; we have reanalyzed these reads using newer assembly techniques in combination with a new tool to remove nucleotides of low quality. The assemblies we made were compared both to each other and to Wenbin’s assemblies. We found that all of our new methods returned a greater percentage of the genome than the earlier methods. In addition, our methods showed improvement in numerous other statistics used to characterize assemblies. Once the best of the new methods has been determined, that method will be applied to the additional 20 species of Araucariaceae for which NGS data are available, and biological analyses will be conducted and compared to Wenbin’s results.

Feb. 24 1:30-1:50 p.m.,Room 137B,The Genetic and Epigenetic Basis of Trichome Production in <i>Mimulus guttatus</i> (Yellow monkeyflower),Sam Neuffer,23,Alison Scoville,Biological Sciences,"Trichomes are sticky leaf hairs that protect <i>Mimulus guttatus</i> (Yellow monkeyflower) from insect herbivory. Trichome production is plastic, meaning plants produce more trichomes on new leaves in response to damage. Progeny of damaged mothers show increased trichome production even without damage, a phenomenon known as epigenetic inheritance. The genes and developmental pathways involved in <i>Mimulus</i> trichome production are not well understood. Constitutive trichome production and plasticity in response to damage was measured in two populations selected for high baseline trichome production and in two control populations. Plants in the selected populations showed significantly higher baseline trichome production.  They also showed decreased plasticity, which is in accordance with optimal defense theory.  Pooled DNA samples from each population were sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology and the data analyzed to find regions of the genome associated with trichome production. Multiple regions of the chromosomes showed response to selection for high trichomes, which is indicative of polygenic inheritance.  These regions are concordant with the results of a related quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping analysis.  Epigenetic inheritance will be measured in future experiments. Understanding the genetics of an ecologically relevant trait not only provides greater understanding of how organisms interact with biotic factors in their environment, but it also provides more information on an emerging model organism."
Feb. 24 1:50-2:10 p.m.,Room 137B,The Invasive Plant Spotted Knapweed Exudate ()-Catechin Inhibits Native Grass Root Growth,Ian  Seiler,23,Clay Arango,Biological Sciences,"Invasive plants decrease native plant diversity and alter ecosystem structure and function, and controlling their spread represents a significant cost to taxpayers. Most exotic species are not invasive in their native range, so successful invasive management requires understanding the biological mechanisms that allow exotic plants to gain advantage over native plants and become invasive. The Novel Weapons Hypothesis postulates that exotic plant exudates, compounds released from plant roots, have an allelopathic effect on native plants that reduces their fitness and decreases their ecological success.  The allelopathic compounds could thus allow an exotic plant to become a superior competitor over native species and reach invasive status. Spotted knapweed (<i>Centaurea stoebe</i>), an introduced European annual, produces the racemic chemical (±)-Catechin, which has allelopathic qualities on the native grass Idaho Fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), though the severity of the allelopathy is contentious and uncertain.  Much research has focused on extreme (±)-Catechin concentrations unlikely to be found in nature, but instead, we tested the dose-dependent effects of environmentally relevant (±)-Catechin concentrations on root growth of Idaho Fescue.  Using germination paper, three replicates of one hundred-twenty Idaho Fescue seeds were placed into rows and grown in (±)-Catechin solution concentrations of 20 ppm and 80 ppm. Catechin was found to significantly inhibit root growth in both concentrations compared to control solutions of water (t-test, p<0.05). This finding supports the Novel Weapons Hypothesis by offering evidence of Spotted Knapweed’s allelopathic nature at environmentally relevant (±)-Catechin concentrations, and it offers insight into proactive invasive plant management."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 137B,Elucidating the Hormonal Regulation of the Claudin Genes in Ovarian Cells,Sean Gadson,23,April Binder,Biological Sciences,"Protein structures called tight junctions adjoin neighboring cells together forming a selective barrier. This barrier separates cellular sheets in a way that allows them to be distinct from other areas of the body. Claudin proteins within these complexes help form and maintain these tight junctions. Prior research suggests that altered regulation of the claudin genes may contribute to the development of diseases in the tissues where they are expressed. An increase in the transcription of a select few claudin genes in ovarian tissues has been observed in estrogen receptor alpha knockout mice. These mice have ovarian phenotypes similar mouse models of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS patients have also been shown to have a greater propensity for the development of ovarian cancer. The ovaries of ovarian cancer patients overexpress a subset of the claudin genes. Normally, these genes are not expressed in a healthy ovary, however in disease states they become expressed. Despite these findings, the regulation of the claudin genes in the ovaries has remained largely unexplored. Using a human ovarian cell line, SKOV-3, this study seeks to characterize the hormonal regulation of the claudin genes in the ovary. Ovarian cells will be treated with testosterone, to mimic the excess testosterone reported in PCOS patients. The expression of claudins 3, 4, 7, and 11 will be measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR in the ovarian cells. This research may shed light on the expression of these genes in PCOS disease states."

To better understand the mechanisms for a switchable macromolecular transport system, preliminary work has been completed that studies the transport of bromothymol blue (BB) facilitated by cetylpyridinium bromide hydrate (CPBM) to a silica surface that has been modified with Poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride), a pH switchable polymer. Ultraviolet spectroscopic trials were conducted measuring the absorbance of BB and CPBM at two pH levels, while holding BB at a constant 1x10<sup>-5</sup>M, varying CPBM between 1 and 10x10<sup>-5</sup>M. Under acidic conditions at pH 3.5, BB and CPBM were attracted to the silica surface, however CPBM had a lower surface concentration, varying from 0.7 to 1.7 times lower. Additionally as the concentration of CPBM was increased, the time to surface of the BB and CPBM also increased by doubling in time at an 8 fold concentration increase. Under basic conditions at pH 9.5, initial attraction of the BB was observed to the silica surface above a concentration of 3x10<sup>-5</sup>M however; as CPBM concentration increased at the surface, the BB concentration decreased. A concentration of 4.5x10<sup>-5</sup>M of CPBM was needed before a low concentration of BB would remain on the silica surface. Further work is to be completed by investigating the reversibility of BBs attraction/repulsion to the silica surface using polyelectrolytes as vehicles of removal as well as further work done on the effect of surface coverage of the bound polymer on the silica surface."

Through their use people are able to visually determine by a color scale whether products have reached their expiration date, or in the case of medical equipment, if the seal to keep the components sterile has been broken and it is therefore no longer safe to use. The goal of this study is to determine the kinetic rate of decay for an indigotetrasulfonate ink through the use of fluorescence spectroscopy. After the kinetics of the system are known, the amount of ink needed for a specific period of time will be able to be determined. As the ink used in this study is oxidized, it changes color from yellow to blue, creating a decrease in fluorescence as it is excited at a wavelength of 520 nm. The rate of ink decay was measured at five different temperatures (room temperature, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C and 60°C) for dilutions of 1:500 and 1:1000 ink to water over a period of three hours. A decrease in emissions was seen as time progressed for each separate sample, and the rates increased along with the temperature."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 140,Total synthesis of clavatadine A analogs to produce a viable reversible inhibitor for factor XIa,Christopher Malmberg,24,Stephen Chamberland,Chemistry,"Cardiovascular disease has quickly become a major health concern in the United States, with numerous citizens dying from cardiovascular disease each year. Older medications, while effective against cardiovascular disease, are problematic to prescribe. A recently isolated natural product, clavatadine A, selectively inhibits human blood coagulation factor XIa. As a result, the synthesis and biological testing of clavatadine A and synthetic clavatadine A analogues that selectively inhibit factor XIa would represent a new direction in cardiovascular disease research. A potent and selective factor XIa inhibitor has the potential to be a safer replacement for current anticoagulants, such as Warfarin.  We recently completed the first total synthesis of clavatadine A and will use our general approach to prepare several synthetic clavatadine A analogues. Clavatadine A binds irreversibly to the active site of factor XIa; therefore, we hope to design a selective, reversible factor XIa inhibitor. We hope to improve the effectiveness of clavatadine A as a potential treatment of blood clotting disorders by modifying its structure to make it a reversible inhibitor. First, we will create four analogues of clavatadine A that we believe will be less likely to form a covalent bond with Ser-195 in the active site of factor XIa, then test the binding activity and selectivity of each analogue toward factor XIa.  Phase two will involve creating additional analogues based off of the strongest and most selective reversibly binding analogue from phase one to further improve the effectiveness of the molecule as a potential factor XIa inhibitor."

As a result, the market demand for efficient vehicles is growing and automakers are tasked with making improvements to engine fuel efficiency in the industry. Under these circumstances, the mechanical parts in the automobile industry are being replaced by electronic methods. The main idea of the electric vehicle is to reduce the engine size and power for fuel consumption and meet the necessary energy from the carbon-free energy sources. Power is transferred electrically instead of mechanically from energy sources to the wheels to reduce the loss of energy. Research has been concerned with various characteristics of motor drive options for selection in electric vehicles (EV) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), including torque, speed, energy efficiency and cost. The most common motors used in industrial application of hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles are: induction, permanent magnet synchronous, switched reluctance, and brushed and brushless DC motors. The intention of this project is to create a method for analysis of speed-torque profiles of various microcontroller-controlled motor drives, allowing for comparison and selection for application for future cross-departmental student collaborations.

This algorithm uses progressive numerical approximations of the forward kinematic model to determine a set of joint parameters that satisfies the specified position and orientation of the end effector.  This provides an easily implementable approach to solving the non-linear inverse kinematics. This paper presents the implementation of the CCD algorithm for the Mitsubishi MELFA RV-6SD Industrial Robot.  The paper provides code samples to illustrate how to develop and implement the forward kinematics model commercially available numerical computing software.  It then demonstrates the application and development of the CCD algorithm from the forward kinematics.  Finally, the paper illustrates how to use the CCD algorithm to linearly interpolate between points within the workspace. This paper provides an introduction to the forward kinematics using the D-H parameters and its application to inverse kinematic problems.  The paper does not address issues involving singular solutions, system dynamics or workspace restrictions within the reachable space. The paper presents a series of examples that are used to develop conceptual understanding in the students.  These examples are progressively constructed so that the students are re-enforcing previous concepts with each project within the course.   "
Feb. 24 1:50-2:10 p.m.,Room 201,Kids in Construction (KIC): An Introduction of STEM Related Careers in Construction Management,Warren Plugge,25,Warren Plugge,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","There is a growing need for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) related jobs all around the world. Students from all areas of Washington were brought to Central Washington University’s Construction Management program funded by the MOSAIC GEAR-UP program to be engaged in a three day camp. KIC introduced forty middle aged students (ages 6th to 9th grade) to the basic elements of what real constructors are engaged in on a daily basis. Students in the camp were introduced to large heavy equipment at the Ellensburg Operators Training Facility, shown a building in the process of being constructed on the CWU campus, built coffee 2 coffee houses in teams provided by the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), constructed concrete pavers by mixing and placing concrete into forms and built and tested balsa wood bridges to test the students’ engineering skills. These activities tested the students’ management, communication and teamwork skills, provided a hands on environment to expose students to the means and methods of construction materials and processes, methods and equipment and tested students’ engineering and mathematical skills.  A central focus of this project was to expose students to an area related to STEM which showcases the basic learning elements commonly found in Construction Management education and related jobs to students at an early age. This research will present on how the curriculum was developed, presented and provide a commentary on future areas of research related to the KIC camp."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 201,Active Learning & Industry Collaboration: Bringing the Real World into the Classroom,David Martin,25,Phillip Plugge,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","Building Information Modeling (BIM) is gaining mainstream acceptance in the construction industry. Construction Management educators at Central Washington University have struggled to successfully implement BIM into the curriculum. However, the construction of the Sciences Building Phase II on Central Washington University’s campus and the aid of an industry partner provided an outstanding opportunity for the students in the Construction Management program to develop their BIM knowledge. The industry partner aiding this effort is contracted to construct the building and developed a BIM for their own project management efforts. The faculty and the industry partner created an active learning BIM workshop and provided the students with the knowledge and skills to manipulate an existing BIM and create a 4D schedule using NAVISWORKS. Students were teamed together and tasked with creating a 4D schedule for the concrete forming, re-steel, placing, and finishing of the building. The teams presented their plans to the industry partner and their fellow students and were evaluated accordingly. Upon completion of the presentations, the industry partner presented his schedule giving students time to reflect on their respective approaches. The active learning opportunities and outcomes of creating and implementing a BIM workshop are presented."
Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Room 271,Tibetan macaque bridging behavior,Grant Clifton,26,Lene Pedersen,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"This presentation includes a short expository documentary that contributes to our understanding a behavior that occurs in Tibetan macaques (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) known as bridging, and presents visual data on the behavior. Bridging is a complex interaction in which two individuals lift an infant between one another and lick the infant’s genitals. The behavior is affiliative, and among males, it is believed to function as a buffer to prevent aggression from dominant individuals. However, bridging is still understudied, and although all age and sex classes engage in bridging, past research has primarily focused on bridging between males. Furthermore, few visual depictions of the behavior exist outside of academic journals. During August-September 2014, I conducted and visually documented a study on female bridging at The Valley of the Wild Monkeys near Huangshan, China, which identified differences between female and male bridging. The documentary around which my presentation is built introduces Tibetan macaques, explains bridging behavior, and summarizes hypotheses on its functionality. Additionally, I describe the gaps that my research fills, and conclude with ideas for future research--all with rich visual depiction."
Feb. 24 1:30-1:50 p.m.,Room 271,<p><i>theatre people</i>: representing live artists and radical hope</p>,Chelsea Roberts,26,Lene Pedersen,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"<p><i>theatre people</i> is a visual project which attempts to represent a radical point of view for a non-specialist audience. I explore the changing role of the performing arts as a vehicle for social change by contrasting conversations with Millenial-aged theatre students and interviews with Living Theatre founder, Judith Malina. Now 88 years old, Malina has been jailed under a brutal dictatorship in Brazil, on the front lines of political theatre in Gaza, Berlin, and Prague, and has contributed invaluably to the culture of American and global performance through anarchist, anti-capitalist performance practices. This short doc creates a conversation with and between these generations of artists, and it is a project which has generated more hope than I expected. I have not employed the traditional expository style. Due to the subject matter an authorial voice seemed out of the question. The film thus utilizes collage aesthetics as a way to represent the collective style of the Living Theatre, and the collaborative nature of theatre-making."
Feb. 24 1:50-2:10 p.m.,Room 271,Biking in the Burg,James King,26,Lene Pedersen,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"This short film focuses on the sport and recreation of mountain biking in and around the Ellensburg area. Through interviews and visual imagery of mountain biking, the film explores the motives behind mountain biking, provides a glimpse into a unique and growing subculture, and offers insight into the positive impacts that biking can have on a personal, community, and worldwide scale. Hands-on footage was collected using a mounted camera, and the images and interviews were collected using a handheld camera. The intention of the film is to expose the audience to the subculture, as well as widen their perspectives on the sport, the environment, and human interactions with nature and each other."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 271,Reflections of Colonialism in Algeria: An Analysis of Four Films,Jordan Talbot,26,Lene Pedersen,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"In this paper, I analyze the representation of French-Algerian relations in four French-language films: The Battle of Algiers, Intimate Enemies, Of Gods and Men, and Outside the Law. Each of the films explores the dynamic between the colonial presence of France in Algeria and the native population. The films present fictionalized versions of true events. For example, Outside the Law features the massacre in Sétif, and Of Gods and Men focuses on the events preceding the 1996 kidnapping of seven Trappist monks by violent radicals in Algeria.Representing the military presence of France seems to be the primary concern of each of the filmmakers. Violent images are the central focus, as three of the four films are set during the Algerian War of Independence. The religious presence of French Catholics is represented more extensively in the film Of Gods and Men. Although the filmmakers represent similar eras, each director shows varying levels of sympathy and disdain for the Algerian National Liberation Front, as well as the contemporaneous French government. The films allow the audience to discover a variety of perspectives on a singular moment of history.

Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Room 301,Comics Without Panels: Alternative Approaches to Graphic Storytelling,Jess  Macinko,27,Anne Cubilié,Douglas Honors College,"This presentation will explore historic and contemporary forms of narrative graphic art, with an emphasis on non-panel or loose-panel methods.  By analyzing diverse approaches to graphic narrative, this presentation will explore the potential for a broader, freer comics universe. “Comics are just words and pictures.  You can do anything with words and pictures.”  So said the late graphic novelist Harvey Pekar, extolling the versatility of his chosen medium.  Yet today, most comics and graphic novels are dominated by the “panel and gutter” form, a grid-like division of the page that isolates illustrations within borders of white space.  And while this tried-and-true organizing structure has many strengths, its hegemonic status within the genre precludes the exploration of alternative, equally fertile forms of graphic narrative. Drawing from diverse sources—including Persian miniature painting, naïve art, 1950s pulp/comic hybrids, and contemporary alternative comics—this presentation will identify and analyze alternative methods, and will consider the challenges and rewards of breaching the traditional panel structure."
Feb. 24 1:30-1:50 p.m.,Room 301,The Perils of Command in the British Navy,Claire Hanberg,27,Liahna Armstrong,English,"This is a creative thesis project focusing on leadership in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Era, during which he Navy played an important military role while fostering its own unique society. The mystique and romance that surrounds the Royal Navy often clashes with equally held notions of a brutal and unforgiving institution of war, two extremes that must be navigated to seek an accurate picture of the Navy and British society of this period. My research will explore naval structures including promotion, command, discipline, society, and shipboard life, among other things. I have studied primary source documents, secondary research, and other works of naval fiction set during this era. The research involved in this project will culminate in a piece of short historical fiction focusing on a First Lieutenant in the British Royal Navy. The Lieutenant faces a dilemma of ethics and of duty – his ship is on the eve of battle, and his Captain is unfit to command. The Lieutenant is compelled to act against his Captain to spare the crew, but must consider that doing so will invite a court martial, and likely his death. The climax of the story will be the Lieutenant’s decision about what action to take against the Captain and how he justifies it. The story will raise questions about duty, honor, and personal sacrifice. My presentation will also highlight my creative process and experience as an author of historical fiction attempting to produce an accurate and engaging story."
Feb. 24 1:50-2:10 p.m.,Room 301,The Missing Meditatio: Leonhard Eulers (1707 1783) contribution to articulatory phonetics,Olivia Hirschey,27,Dominic Klyve,Mathematics,"This is an interdisciplinary research project combining the history of mathematics and linguistics. The work describes the contributions of Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), the 18th- century physicist and mathematician, to the fields of articulatory and experimental phonetics.  First, the authors provide evidence for Euler’s role in establishing the St. Petersburg Academy prize of 1780. Next, they consider a short and posthumously published work of Euler, the Meditatio de formatione vocum. It is shown that the Meditatio represents an early attempt to compare vowels in several languages, and includes a two-dimensional classification of vowels which anticipates in many ways the International Phonetic Alphabet vowel chart."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Room 301,The Guiding Factor: Music In American Cinema,Jordan Vidmore,27,Anne Cubilié,Douglas Honors College,"In this presentation, I examine the ways in which music has been incorporated into some of Americas best, and worst, films and the effect this has had on the viewers perception of the story. Through consideration of the diegetic and non-diegetic use of music in film, case studies of the relation of human nature to music, and the association between the musical, dialogical, and visual elements of film in the cognitive framework I argue that music has a guiding factor in the viewers perception of the visual and dialogical elements of the film. In the words of director Steven Spielberg, “[T]he eye sees better when the sound is great.”?"
Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Ballroom A,Crossroads Recording Project: Orchestral Mentoring Program,Ryan Anderson,28,Todd Shiver,Music,"The purpose of creating ""Crossroads"" is to collaborate with the phenomenal theatre talent of Seattle, to create a recording of where I am now as a artist/performer, to give back to the education programs that got me to where I am today and to offer the world a new version of classic showtunes in an artistic format that is tangible to my scholastic endeavors in my major of musical theatre. The idea of “crossroads” acts as the motif for this project, to inform many of the artistic perspectives of the characters in each of these pieces. Not only will many characters intersect lives in this recording, but also all of the artists will cross paths to collaborate with each other when they all intersect together to create this artistic expression. With the profits of the sales of the album, a portion of funds will go back to the theatre education programs in Seattle (5th Avenue Rising Star Project and Northwest Choirs) and to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. In my scholastic work, the exploration into these songs each develops a different moment, decision or conflict between the characters involved. From this project there will be an established analysis about producing a successful artistic piece of work through collaborating with other artists on a vision, developing different artistic talents in the studio and learning how to nurture a learning process in a high stress environment of a professional recording studio."
Feb. 24 1:30-1:50 p.m.,Ballroom A,Inspiration and Expression: How Language Revealed My Music,George Barker,28,Laurie Moshier,World Languages,"This project is a musical response to a simple class assignment.  Second-year German students were asked to analyze the syntactic and semantic elements of the poem Vergnügungen by German poet Bertolt Brecht. Following their analysis students were asked to write their own poem; maintaining the form but not the content of the original Brecht poem.  Through the poems, which speak of the pleasures of life, the viewer can observe the expression of diverse character traits, as well as common themes through each poem.  When viewed collectively the poetry exhibits the development of an individual through various stages in life. This observation formed the basis for a musical project, taking the spirit of the poetry and translating it into musical form. Specifically, the piece draws from three of the poems that were representative of the whole body of poetry.  Each poem exhibited characteristics peculiar to three phases of life: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.  The composition, drawing from the language of the poems, produces an auditory likeness of the development of an individual from youth through adolescence, to adulthood, emphasizing the differences in each stage through tempo and mode (i.e. Shifting from major key to minor) While illustrating the differences in each phase of life, the piece emphasizes the unchanging and eternal aspects of an individual’s character through the use of repetition in chord structure and thematic development.  The author will give an oral presentation of the project, and follow with a performance on the piano of the resulting piece."
Feb. 24 1:50-2:10 p.m.,Ballroom A,An Examination of Italian Commedia dell'Arte in Mozart's Opera Buffa,Caitlin Stave,28,Gayla Blaisdell,Music,"The operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are fascinating examples of the genre as it existed in the Classical Period. As the creators of the first operas drew upon the example of Greek tragedy, so was Mozart influenced by dramatic traditions of the past. In particular, there is considerable evidence of the influence of the Italian Renaissance dramatic tradition known as commedia dell’arte on his operatic dramas and the characters within them. This presentation will demonstrate that elements of commedia dell’arte are strongly present in several of Mozart's operas, namely Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte. I will address the origin of commedia dell’arte and identify the character archetypes that grew out of this art form. I will then provide a brief synopsis of each opera after which I will discuss the characters and their similarities to their corresponding commedia archetypes. My presentation will also examine the similarities between commedia scenarios and comedic opera plots and I will briefly discuss the voice types (or fachs) which evolved in collusion with character and scenic archetypal development."
Feb. 24 2:10-2:30 p.m.,Ballroom A,Dmitri Shostakovich's <i>The Nose <i>: A False-Start on Russian <i> Avant-garde <i> Modernism,William Thornton,28,Gayla Blaisdell,Music,"Following the 1917 Russian Revolution the performing arts were greatly impacted on nearly all fronts - except opera. Left to the wayside, expanding the operatic canon into a more modern format and finding a truly Soviet voice was not even considered by composers for a multitude of reasons. These omissions from Soviet cultural life seemed to change with the publishing of Dimitri Schostakovich's <i>avant-garde<i> masterpiece <i>The Nose<i>. Within this presentation, a survey of the social and cultural climate surrounding <i>The Nose<i> will be discussed, as well as the Soviet culture following <i>The Nose<i> which made modernity in Russian opera a near impossibility for many years to come."
Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Theatre,"Film Comparison: ""La Femme infidele"" (1969) and ""Unfaithful"" (2002)",Caleb Allison,29,Liahna Armstrong,English,"I will be presenting and expanding on my final paper, a film comparison, in French Cinema from Winter Quarter of this year. When a Hollywood director remakes a foreign film, one may expect an experience that is a distant cousin, rather than a close twin, to its original. Loose ends in the narrative are tied up, moral ambiguity is reworked to depict a clear right and wrong, and patriarchal dominance is bolstered and reaffirmed to preserve the structure of American society as a whole. I will compare French director Claude Chabrol’s ""La Femme infidèle"" (1969) with Adrian Lyne’s Hollywood remake ""Unfaithful"" (2002). While Lyne manages to preserve in part certain French qualities of the original, in the end he cannot help but take sides, notably punishing each wrongdoer for his or her moral failings—a stance not taken by Chabrol. My presentation will include visuals via PowerPoint slides, stills and clips from the two films, excerpts from my paper, and additional arguments and insights expanded for the purposes of this talk. I will expound on the qualities characteristic of French film and those unique to Hollywood, examining the work of each director and exploring how they embody the values of their respective markets. Dr. Liahna Armstrong, my instructor in French Cinema, has been my mentor throughout this process. I owe the vast broadening of my understanding in cinema studies in no small part to her thought-provoking teachings and the genuine encouragement she lavishes upon the individuals in her care."
Feb. 24 1:30-1:50 p.m.,Theatre,Film Music and Audience Expectations,Lauren Leshley,29,Melissa Johnson,Film and Video Studies,"This paper covers the functions and uses of music in mainstream films. While its original purpose was to distract the audience from elements that might lessen the illusion of reality, today’s film music seeks to enhance emotion, set the tone for audience expectation, and communicate about characters’ mental states and their relationships with one another. Films with notable scores that accomplish these goals are Up, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Up’s score consists of one main theme that is played throughout the film. Originally, it represents Carl’s wife Ellie and their life together; after she dies, it comes to represent more generally the spirit of adventure his wife possessed. Pirates of the Caribbean’s characters have various leitmotifs that are combined at the end into a triumphant called “He’s a Pirate” that symbolizes the main character’s victory and growth. Treasure of the Sierra Madre has several themes that communicate much about the genre and events of the film, but also give clues as to the mental state of Fred C. Dobbs, whose mental health starts to deteriorate the more gold he finds. Each of these shows how film music can be used for multiple purposes to enhance audience experience."
Feb. 24 1:50-2:10 p.m.,Theatre,Star Wars' and Sci-Fi's Coming of Age,Caleb Allison,29,Melissa Johnson,Film and Video Studies,"George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" (1977) marked a crucial turning-point in film history, reshaping how science-fiction films could and should present themselves, incorporating themes never before used in the genre, reaching an audience untouched by its predecessors, and establishing a firm and economically viable market for sci-fi films that had hitherto not existed. I will be presenting my final paper from History of Narrative Film from Winter Quarter of this year: ""'Star Wars' and Sci-Fi's Coming of Age"". I will explore the narrative and aesthetic elements that set “Star Wars” apart as a groundbreaking science-fiction film within its historical and cultural context. My presentation will include visuals via PowerPoint slides, incorporating stills and brief clips from the film where necessary, as well as a version of my essay that I have modified to fit as a verbal presentation. Prof. Melissa Johnson has been my mentor throughout this process. As always, her input and support are truly invaluable. I am grateful for the opportunity to present my findings at SOURCE this year!"
Feb. 24 2:40-3:00 p.m.,Room 135,The Intermingling of Art and Science,Alyssa Willard,30,Stephen Robison,Art,"From prehistoric times to the Renaissance, there was little distinction drawn between art and science.  Today they continue to influence each other but are becoming increasingly separated.  The intermingling of the arts and sciences are essential for technological advancements within our society; both are important aspects of culture, driven by creativity and their influences on each other are profound and diverse.  In science, as in art, it is necessary to tap into imagination and creativity in order to rise above accepted knowledge to create new models and theories that can accommodate new knowledge.  Art that explores technological and scientific frontiers asks questions about the possibilities and implications of technological innovation just like scientific research would. They differ in their perceptions and concepts that they explore, but are similar in that both artists and scientists contribute to developing new ideas. In the body of work I am creating in conjunction with this analysis I am melding nature and technology.  This relates to the blending of art and science because science is the study of nature, and constructed objects are art. Although the point of this thesis is show how these two subjects rely on one another to advance, my artwork will be used to highlight the shift in our mindsets towards nature and how we attempt to emulate the complex beauty of nature with unnecessary advanced technologies.  Therefore, these new scientific advancements and their implications have become the inspiration for my artwork."
Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Room 135,Queer Photography and the Betrayal of the Image,Philippe (Hyojung) Kim,30,Ellen Avitts,Art,"“Queer” is a descriptor of what is non-normative, generally associated with the rejection of traditional identities. What is “queer” is counter to what is accepted as ""normal.”  Photography, as a visual medium, is often used to reveal a subject and inform an audience. Queer photography has historically been utilized to expose the ""normal"" masses to what is not normal, and also to inform a select audience of what is acceptably queer. Our study proposes that queer photography establishes a self-negating concept: as a visual medium that aims to inform, photography has come to define a set “norm” for queer and has led to certain expectations for queer viewers and the non-queer public.  Through an exploration of the visual history of queer photography, this study analyzes its effect on contemporary visual and popular culture and how the current structure of queer portrayal has betrayed the reality of the queer."
Feb. 24 3:20-3:40 p.m.,Room 135,Banish All The World - The Contrarianism of John Osborne,Joshua Kelly,30,Jay Ball,Theatre,"In this paper, I will explore the theme of “intersections of performance and philosophy” by explaining the use of contrarianism in the work and life of John Osborne and show how it was essential in the success of his drama. In order to best exemplify this, I will be theoretically engaging British philosopher John Stuart Mill and his work in ""On Liberty"" to talk about necessity of attacking what he called “the deep slumber of a decided opinion” on principle—or contrarianism for its own sake. Through the use of this methodology, we will see how (whether or not Osborne was aware of it) his continuous position of being anti- some ideas but rarely pro- others was a key component of his ability to write characters such as Jimmy Porter, and by engaging ""On Liberty"", we can deduce that contrarianism helped Osborne produce art that brought much needed life to a conventional 1956 English theatre. It is by this assumption that the questioning of the status quo is just as artistically beneficial as the presentation of original thought that Osborne makes his mark in dramatic history, and what becomes a fulcrum in the messages of ""Look Back in Anger"", ""The Entertainer"", and many of his published essays including ""A Letter To My Fellow Countrymen.""  "
Feb. 24 3:40-4:00 p.m.,Room 135,"Qui est francais?: Negotiating National Identity in Alain Badiou's ""Ahmed philosophe""",Jordan Talbot,30,Jay Ball,Theatre,"Alain Badiou’s character Ahmed is often compared to Molière’s classic character Scapin. Both characters are tricksters who use their lower-class status in order to speak truth to power. However, Badiou uses Ahmed to challenge the political climate of France, while Scapin merely pokes at the silliness of the French bourgeois. Scapin is assumed to be an intellectual because he is already French. Ahmed must advocate for his status as an intellectual. In this paper, I conduct a close reading of Ahmed philosophe, looking at the relationship between Ahmed and Madame Pompestan. Ahmed’s conversations with Madame Pompestan explore the construction of French identity and French intellectualism. Through their interactions, the audience can understand that Ahmed has as much of a right to the intellectual, philosophical, and political traditions of France as the most elite members of the French government, represented by Madame Pompestan."
Feb. 24 2:40-3:00 p.m.,Room 137A,Does the United States' Constitution Protect Black Males from Police Homicide? ,La-James Brown,31,Charles Reasons,Law & Justice,"This will entail a thorough analysis of the 4th and 14th Amendment and the extent to which it protects Black males from police homicide. Historical analysis of the treatment of Black African Americans Pre-Constitution, will set the stage for Post-Constitutional analysis. Major cases will be discussed and analyzed in the context of contemporary police homicides in the United States.  "
Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Room 137A,A Prosperous Hispanic Population Equates To a Robust America,Edgar  Zamora,31,Stefanie  Wickstrom,Political Science,"For the last decade, the American political, economic, and educational landscape has weathered a destructive storm. That period of time left a large amount of Americans battered, but those effected managed to make it through. As a new age dawns in the United States, so does a new challenge. The crisis is that American leaders are omitting the Hispanic population to the point that their influences on politics, economics and education are being overlooked. These actions toward the Hispanic population need to be rectified. The reason is that according to the U.S. Census, Hispanics will constitute about 30 percent of the entire population by 2050, making their influence greater as the years go by. There is less chance of Hispanic influence on politics, economy, and education being utilized correctly if this information is not realized. Thus, change through policies has to be made in politics, economics, and education to allow Hispanics to improve their status. These areas have to be split into sub-sections for evaluation. Politics will be addressed through voter turnout, local and national elections and the 2016 presidential election. For economics, Hispanics’ influence on labor force and buying power within the United States will need to be addressed. Lastly, education will address Hispanic college attainment and immigrant students within the United States. By analyzing the elements of politics, economy, and education, one will begin to understand why Hispanics are critical for the future of America. "
Feb. 24 3:20-3:40 p.m.,Room 137A,Questionable Immunity,Christopher Bertomeu,31,Charles Reasons,Law & Justice,"Do military personnel have more restrictions on use of deadly force than domestic police? When you put on a uniform for work, and carry a sidearm, the public places great trust in the decisions you will make. Military personnel and police officers are afforded this trust, in which they are expected to do their jobs appropriately. What happens when one or the other breaks this trust, and uses deadly force in the accomplishment of their jobs. It seems in most cases police officers are afforded qualified immunity when it comes to fatal shooting incidents, whereas military personnel are not afforded the same consideration. Do police officers experience more autonomy, while military personnel experience more bureaucracy?  Do we expect more “control” over deadly use of force from our military personnel versus what we expect out of our police officers? These questions will be explored through statutes, case law, regulations, and recent incidents. With events happening in many departments and U.S. forces still deployed overseas, it is important to address this question. Through education and understanding a possibility for effective change can take place."
Feb. 24 3:40-4:00 p.m.,Room 137A,United States of Surveillance,Kyle James,31,Todd Schaefer,Political Science,"In June 2013, Americans learned that Orwell’s Big Brother was much more than speculation when ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked information on the NSA’s collection of telephony metadata and other national surveillance programs. Since the 9/11 attacks, American citizens have paid the price and been victimized in the process of national security. Unfortunately, the current classified natures of the bills regulating these programs are not transparent enough to disclose information to the public. With the information world growing around us faster than we can develop laws and security to match, there is a greater need to reform the laws currently governing us to protect the autonomy of our personal data – big or small. This paper examines Internet privacy laws and regulations, the leaked surveillance programs that coattail these acts, evaluates the proposed legal reforms, and describes how to fight back as a citizen.

Feb. 24 1:10-1:30 p.m.,Room 137B,Effect of black carbon nanoparticles on epithelial cell proliferation,Naomi Beebe,24,Anne Johansen,Chemistry,"Black carbon (BC) nano particles (NPs) have been shown to reduce cell proliferation leading to cell death, and they have been implicated in adverse health effects to the cardiovascular system. While the exact mechanisms of action are unknown, it is generally accepted that their role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the main cause of these detrimental effects. Here, cell toxicity assays are performed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and relevant particle characteristics. Particles used in this study are derived from the combustion of fossil fuels, and are being characterized for surface area, surface speciation, as well as trace metal content. The cell proliferation assay, MTS, is applied to quantify the effects of the BC NPs on C10 cells, which are type II mouse lung epithelial cells. Preliminary data show a decrease in cell viability as the concentration of particles increases. Assays will also be performed on cells exposed to BC NPs with ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and anthraquinone (AQ), as results from previous studies correlated increased disruption of the electron transport chain with these two NP constituents in collected aerosol samples. Results from this work will complement data currently obtained on the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of these particles in biologically relevant medium and allow us to better understand underlying mechanisms of cell disruption and what particle characteristics are key players in this process."
Feb. 24 2:40-3:00 p.m.,Room 137B,Phthalate Esters Exacerbate Neurodegeneration in a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i> Parkinsons Disease Model. ,Jacob Darley,32,Lucinda  Carnell,Biological Sciences,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) extracts a significant medical and financial toll on the developed world and is second only to Alzheimer’s disease in terms of prevalence as a neurodegenerative disease. Up to 90% of PD cases are idiopathic or environmental in origin. Benzyl Butyl Phthalate (BBzP) and Bis (2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate are plasticizers, compounds used in industry to improve the malleability and durability of plastic products, which were evaluated for their potential contribution to neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons in a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i> (roundworm) PD model. These phthalates were assessed for effect in two genetic worm strains of PD. The first genetic strain is a transgenic animal expressing the human alpha-synuclein gene that is known to contribute to PD in humans. The second strain was a transgenic animal that overexpressed tyrosine hydroxylase, leading to excess production of reactive oxygen species; another suspected cause of PD neurodegeneration in humans. It was discovered that different PD models were affected by different phthalate esters. DEHP induced neurodegeneration in non-genetically predisposed animals at ten days post exposure and in the tyrosine hydroxylase model at seven and ten days post-exposure while BBzP only exacerbated neurodegeneration at ten days post-exposure. Further BBzP exacerbated neurodegeneration in the alpha-synuclein model at day seven and ten. Our results suggest that phthalate esters could be important in the development of Parkinson’s disease. "
Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Room 137B,Water in the Diet of the Great Basin Pocket Mouse ,Robin Skewis,32,Kristina Ernest,Biological Sciences,"The Great Basin Pocket Mouse (Perognathus parvus) is an inhabitant of arid regions that can obtain all its water needs from food sources (mainly seeds) instead of from drinking water. I tested the hypothesis that the Great Basin Pocket Mouse prefers seeds with higher water content.  I compared preferences of a captive pocket mouse for different seed types with varying water content as well as dried seeds versus pre-moistened seeds.  Six different dried seed types were tested in two groups of similar sized seeds: Millet, Milo, Flax (Group 1, small seeds), and Sunflower, Wheat, and Cracked Corn (Group 2, large seeds). Each group was offered to the Pocket Mouse twice a day for two weeks. Among the smaller dry seeds, the pocket mouse preferred millet over milo, and did not select any flaxseed.  Among the larger seeds, the pocket mouse preferred wheat, which was the seed type with the highest water content. In a second experiment, a control (dry) seed mixture (equal parts of all six seed types) and an experimentally moistened group (same seed mixture) were offered to the pocket mouse.  The Pocket Mouse preferred dried seeds over pre-moistened seeds.  These results suggest that the Pocket Mouse prefers dried seeds over rehydrated seeds.  The dry seeds preferred by the mouse had 8-12% water (by weight), and may have provided some water through metabolic breakdown of lipids."
Feb. 24 3:20-3:40 p.m.,Room 137B,A comparison of female-female bridging to male-male bridging in Tibetan macaques (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>),Grant Clifton,32,Lori Sheeran,Primate Behavior & Ecology,"Bridging is an affiliative interaction in which two individuals lift an infant between each other and lick the infant’s genitals. Male-male bridging has been studied in several macaque (<i>Macaca</i>) species, but female-female bridging has received less focus. Male-male bridging is believed to act as a way to reduce social tension between individuals, but it may function differently for females. We studied female-female bridging in provisioned Tibetan macaques (<i>M. thibetana</i>) from August-September 2014. We predicted that female-female bridging would show distinct patterns when compared to what has been reported for males. We recorded bridging behavior from an ethogram using all-occurrences and focal-animal sampling of 8 adult and 4 subadult females. Similar to what has been observed for males, female-female bridges were never immediately followed by aggression, and females utilized infants more often than juveniles. Unlike what has been reported in males, within female-female bridging dyads, initiators were not more likely to be subordinate to recipients (<i>W</i> = 45, <i>n</i> = 17, <i>p</i> > 0.05). Bridge initiation rates were strongly correlated with social rank (<i>r<small>s</small></i> = 0.73, <i>n</i> = 12, <i>p</i> < 0.05), but there was no significant relationship between bridge reception rates and social rank (<i>r<small>s</small></i> = 0.30, <i>n<i> = 12, <i>p<i> > 0.05). Receivers more frequently held infants in bridges, which is significantly different than what has been reported in males (<i>?²</i> = 42.23, <i>df</i> = 1, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Our results suggest that female-female bridging is more likely related to female interest in infants than to social tension between individuals."
Feb. 24 2:40-3:00 p.m.,Room 140,Assessment of Anthelminthic Activity of Plant Extracts on Ancylostoma ceylanicum and the Development of a Toxicity Bioassay,Jocelyn McCornack,33,Blaise Dondji,Biological Sciences,"Soil-transmitted helminthes are intestinal parasites that contribute to major disease burden in people within tropical and impoverished areas.  It has been estimated this blood sucking parasite has been responsible for the loss of over one million liters of blood per day.  Recently, resistance to current control programs has rendered it necessary to develop new treatments.  Earlier projects within the lab have assessed the anthelmintic effects of plant extracts and their enriched fractions on Ancylostoma ceylanicum ex vivo. The plants Dalea ornata and Oemlaria cerasiformis have shown efficacy—adult worms have demonstrated either significant decreases in motility or mortality.  The additional fractions tested, however, did not display anthelminthic activity. Another important step was to develop an assay testing the toxicity of the extracts to mammalian cells.  Three were attempted: a Trypan Blue assay, a Flow Cytometer assay and a Cell Counting Kit assay. All of them used hamster splenocytes with the extracts at various concentrations. Death and mitosis was monitored over a three to five day period and compared with the control.  "
Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Room 140,Detection of <i>Leishmania</i> Parasites via Flow Cytometry,Analiese Wenger,33,Gabrielle Stryker,Biological Sciences,"<i>Leishmania</i> species cause a spectrum of diseases collectively referred to as the Leishmaniases. These unicellular parasites generate 1.3 million new cases of infection worldwide as well as cause an approximated 20,000-30,000 deaths annually. Current techniques for studying Leishmaniasis in laboratory animals require laborious serial plating of dilution series, incubations of samples for weeks, followed by microscopic screening of each individual well in 96 well plates.  Through the generous funding of both the W. M. Keck Foundation and the Murdock Fund, Biological Sciences recently obtained a flow cytometer. This study aimed at assessing if flow cytometry could differentiate cells infected with <i>Leishmania</i> parasites from uninfected cells. Two species of the parasite, <i>L. infantum</i> and <i>L. major</i>, were stained with an antibody conjugated to a florescent fluorochrome, using both flow cytometry and photomicroscopy to detect the parasites. Fluorescent staining of parasites illustrated a shift in florescence intensity using flow cytometry and easily visualized parasites using microscopy. However, a modified protocol for intracellular staining of the murine macrophage cell line, J774A.1, did not reveal a separation between the infected cells and uninfected cells using flow cytometry. The parasites within cells were also undetectable using fluorescent microscopy.  Although the hypothesis that there would be a detectable segregation between infected and uninfected cells was not met, this work will continue to attempt to develop what would be a time saving tool in <i>Leishmania</i> research."
Feb. 24 3:20-3:40 p.m.,Room 140,"Evaluation of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> strains in Jalisco, Mexico",Uyen Nguyen,33,Gabrielle Stryker,Biological Sciences,"<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a single-celled flagellated parasite of mammals, including humans. Chagas disease is endemic throughout much of Mexico, Central and South America where an estimated 8 million people are infected.  The disease is transmitted by infected triatomine bugs, a blood-sucking insect. <i>T. cruzi</i> exists in at least 7 unique clonal strains circulating between wild or domestic mammals and triatomine bugs.  The strains are found in distinct areas and are associated with different disease pathologies in humans.  Each strain can be further divided into discrete genotypes using sequence analysis.  The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the <i>T. cruzi</i> strains and genotypes found in and around the dry tropical forest at <i>Estación de Biología Chamela</i> (EBCh) in Jalisco, Mexico. Jalisco is known to have the highest Chagas infection rate in Mexico. Triatomine bugs were collected by hand and using pitfall traps at EBCh. The gut contents were placed on FTA paper, which renders any parasites non-infectious and preserve the parasite’s DNA for testing upon return to Central Washington University. Two common gene fragments of parasite DNA, TcSC5D and intergenic region of mini-exon, were amplified using PCR to identify <i>T. cruzi</i> strains. Each <i>T. cruzi</i> positive sample was sequenced to determine the parasite genotypes. DNA sequences are analyzed using ClustalW program. Initial results demonstrate that the <i>T. cruzi</i> strain at EBCh is restricted to TcI. This research will aid in a better understanding of Chagas disease infection dynamics in Jalisco, Mexico."
Feb. 24 2:40-3:00 p.m.,Room 201,The Road Less Traveled ,Josh  Ingebretson,34,Jenna Hyatt,University Housing and New Student Programs (UHNSP),"Every year there are millions of students worldwide who attend a higher education institution. Each individual carefully takes the time to choose between a wide set of pre-planned major/minors. These degrees may range from topics such as biology to sociology. However, what happens to those students who are faced with a list of degrees that don’t fit their career path. That same challenge is the obstacle that I have had to overcome when it came to my future career aspirations of working within Higher Education. As a 2nd year student I was faced with the reality of having to choose an undergraduate degree that wasn’t specific to my future career path, until I discovered the Inter-Disciplinary Studies (IDS) program at Central Washington University. Through this revolutionary program I have had the ability to forge my own pathway during my undergraduate career. This flexibility of designing and implementing my own degree has allowed the opportunity to have priceless experiences in both the classroom and real world situations. Those experiences have already given me an incredible advantage as I embark further into my career. It is my testimony that offering unique programs such as the IDS degree allows the precious opportunity for those students who don’t align perfectly with a pre-planned major, to forge their own pathway. This unique pathway furthermore allows those same students to create an intentional undergraduate degree, which allows them to graduate as competitive applicants in a specialized career field of their choosing, such as Higher Education.

Specifically, the study evaluates effectiveness based on four program objectives, (1) completion of undergraduate mentored research, (2) enrollment in a post-baccalaureate degree program in the fall term following graduation from CWU, (3) continued enrollment in a post-baccalaureate degree program at the beginning of the fall term of the following year, and (4) completion of a doctoral degree or PhD within 10 years of graduation from CWU. Study results offer strong support that CWU’s McNair program has fulfilled its objectives beyond expectations as measured by stated program objectives, and, with the help of outstanding CWU faculty mentors who serve as advisors and role models and strong administrative support, the program is successfully advancing undergraduate student participants in mentored research, post-baccalaureate education and, ultimately, a doctoral degree for a sizable percentage.

Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Room 271,Look at me I am the Captain now: Media Representations of Somalis and their Implications. ,Saeed Mohamed,35,Lene Pedersen,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Popular media representations of Somalis, such as the Hollywood blockbuster film, ""Captain Phillips"", affect both Somali and non-Somali perceptions of Somali men and women.  In our research we review such media representations, which emphasize drug abuse, violence and criminality among and by Somalis. Captain Phillips, for example, depicts Somalis in a controversial light—portraying them as barbarians, savages, and uncivilized, in a storyline, which glorifies American triumph.  In a both reflective and impressionistic style of video production, we use the camera as a catalyst to solicit reactions from both Somali and non-Somali students at Central Washington University. We analyze and visually represent the different stereotypical images as well as capture student reactions. Somali students in the United States retain strong ties with their homeland and therefore are bound to view representations like ""Captain Phillips"" through a more complex perspective than non-Somali students. Furthermore, they are likely to view Captain Phillips' perspectives as one dimensional, predictable, flat and shallow, whereas non-Somali students in the United States may view this film as truth and fact, and hail Captain Phillips' efforts as heroic and patriotic."

If you think the only way a person could bring themselves to volunteer for this war is through sheer desperation or blind obedience then consider me the exception.""-2nd Lt. Mark J Daily.  My short entitled, For Mark, will take the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster while looking at a soldier (Mark. J Daily) that fought in the War in Iraq. My hope is that this experience will spark the reality of war to those that deter from this touchy subject. Through Mark's eyes, viewers will be given insight that not every young man who joins the servicedoes so blindly ""for the cause"" but can have a righteous inclination of why they join. Mark was someone who could look through the political jargon to find an ultimate cause he valued and sought to fight for. Although this commemoration is emotional, I hope it brings positive insight and reflection to those dealing or have dealt with loss of family and friends during times of war. Mark could see a light even in the darkest times and through his writings he was able to impact many."
Feb. 24 2:40-3:00 p.m.,Room 301,"History, Identity and the Origins of the Israeli-Palestine Conflict",Maggie  Krienen,36,Geraldine O'Mahony,Philosophy & Religious Studies,"Modern media today portrays the conflict between the Israeli and Palestinian people as a religious battle, but it did not start that way. Historical analysis has shown that the conflict started over a battle for land. The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is extremely valuable to understanding both sides because there are two narratives of history, one from each side, each claiming to be victims of the other. Describing the historical narrative of the Arab-Israeli conflict allows the spotlight to be taken off of religion to show how religion is not the cause of this war, but a tool used by both sides. In this project I will examine the history and culture of both the Jews and the Arabs in Palestine and give a brief analysis of the mindset of both groups, comparing and contrasting their cultural ideologies. Identity also plays an integral part in this conflict. Religion plays a part in this conflict, but it is not the centerpiece. The topics covered I have traced the history of the Zionist movement as well as the role Britain has played in the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict as well. I will describe both sides of the conflict and show the progression of how a land dispute became a bloody battle in the name of religion. "
Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Room 301,Sharing the Nile : The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam,Matthew Baldwin,36,Anne Cubilié,Douglas Honors College,"With construction of Africa's largest hydroelectric power station, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), beginning in 2011 and slated for completion in 2017, Ethiopia has catapulted itself to a position of power in the Blue Nile Basin. Located forty-five kilometers from Sudan's border, the dam is to be the largest hydroelectric power station throughout all of Africa, eclipsing Egypt's Aswan Dam with over twice the electricity output which will be delivered throughout Ethiopia and sold to neighboring countries. However, the construction of the GERD represents a significant departure from past water sharing agreements between states in the Blue Nile Basin, which have traditionally heavily favored Egypt. Remnants of British and Italian colonialism and regional power dynamics have long stymied Ethiopia's use of the Nile. However within the last decade intergovernmental organizations and shifting power dynamics of the region have paved the way for Ethiopia's rise to being a dominant power along the Nile, a reshaping of how resources can be managed, and enabled development of the GERD."
Feb. 24 3:20-3:40 p.m.,Room 301,Dowry Death and the Caste System in India,Sonya  Rombough,36,Anne Cubilié,Douglas Honors College,"Social and religious cultural norms and practices have a heavy impact on the experience of people existing within their boundaries. In a culture that still widely practices arranged marriages and dowries, despite them being outlawed over fifty years ago, the effects of these cultures may have a stronger impact on the experiences of victims of domestic abuse. In India domestic abuse and violence against women has taken a turn towards the extreme in the form of dowry death, which is defined as the murder of a bride within her first seven years of murder, usually as the end result of unmet demands for monetary or material gains. This paper offers an in depth analysis of the direct relationship between the caste system and the proliferation of dowry death in India. Some studies have gone so far as to indicate that one’s place within the caste system effects the ease of access to justice resources such as police and courts. This paper also seeks to draw connections between such studies and the overarching social norms that allow such imbalances to continue. "
Feb. 24 3:40-4:00 p.m.,Room 301,"Language and Legislation: Bilingual Education in the United States, 18th century-present",Olivia Hirschey,36,Susana Flores,Educational Foundations & Curriculum,"This project is a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between politics and bilingual education in the United States, from the eighteenth through twenty-first centuries. It first examines the historical foundations of public schools in the United States. Then, it analyzes nineteenth century educational policies, focusing on German and Spanish speaking students as well as Native American missionary schools. Next, it assesses key court cases and legislation in the twentieth century, including the Bilingual Education Act. Finally, it looks at the current state of bilingual education, examining the issues from both linguistic and political perspectives. This project will assess both English language learning students and native-English speaking students who are learning a second language in order to fully encapsulate the scope of bilingual education.From this historical analysis, the project then begins to assess not just the “what,” but the “why” of American bilingual education, analyzing institutionalized racism and issues in research in order to examine the current capacity and controversy of bilingual education in key states. As a whole, the goal of this research is to see not only how politics have affected bilingual education policy, and how those policies have changed throughout time, but ultimately to see how these policies and practices affect students.

Feb. 24 3:00-3:20 p.m.,Ballroom A,Concert Performance of Clusters by Douglas Hill,Mary Jarvis,37,Jeffrey Snedeker,Music,"On April 11th, 2015 the CWU Horn Ensemble performed at the 2015 Northwest Horn Symposium in Eugene, Oregon.  The centerpiece of our performance was the world premiere of Clusters by the noted horn teacher and composer, Douglas Hill.  Our horn ensemble has worked with Professor Hill in the past and had the chance to develop a working rapport with him.  When he finished composing this piece he offered us the opportunity to premiere it.  This piece of music was a scholarship challenge for every member of the ensemble because of the need for part independence, the use of playing techniques unique to Hill’s music, and the pressure of learning a piece of which there are no recordings.  Our SOURCE performance of this piece will have the benefit of multiple performances and further input from the composer.  The premiere performance received Undergraduate Travel Fellowship which requires SOURCE participation."

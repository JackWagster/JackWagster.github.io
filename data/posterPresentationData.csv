Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Assessing Earthquake Preparedness in Southern Ellensburg,Brian Lawrence,Geological Sciences,"Because Ellensburg is situated in an area of moderate seismic risk, it is critical that the community is made aware of risks they face, and utilize existing mitigation plans and strategies to best prepare themselves for a seismic event. As a class, we studied the earthquake hazard in Ellensburg, and assessed the degree to which the community and economy is vulnerable to a seismic hazard. We conducted a city-wide survey to ask the community about their earthquake knowledge and preparedness. Our sub-group was assigned to research the southern region of Ellensburg, covering between Water Street and Chestnut Street, and Capitol Avenue and East Umptanum Road. Using existing resources from the Kittitas County Planning Office, we extrapolated the county?s susceptibility data to our southern region of Ellensburg. We studied the liquefaction susceptibility of the soil in our region. Using this data, residential and commercial facilities were examined using Federal Emergency Management Agency rapid visual screening protocol. We found that residential buildings tended to score higher than commercial buildings. In addition, critical facilities in our region?such as Lincoln Elementary and Kittitas Valley Community Hospital?were asked about their existing earthquake plans. Based on any existing mitigation strategies these facilities had in place, as well as our own findings, we made recommendations on how to better prepare these facilities for a seismic event. These included expanding education efforts, as well as providing emergency kits to stakeholders. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Analysis of Earthquake Hazards in Eastern Ellensburg,Eamonn Clarke,Geological Sciences,"This research served to gather and analyze data relating to the seismic hazards in Eastern Ellensburg, the area from N. Chestnut Street to the city limits, and University Way to the Kittitas Highway, and develop strategies to mitigate those hazards. The Federal Emergency Management Agency?s Rapid Visual Screening process was used to gather data on buildings in the area such as the fairground structures, high school, and faith centers. Research of existing literature was conducted to determine the underlying risks, including liquefaction, and a survey of residents was conducted assessing risk perception and emergency preparedness. The Ellensburg Annex to the Kittitas County Hazard Mitigation Plan was analyzed and suggestions were made for additions at the next revision. Research showed Eastern Ellensburg to have varying liquefaction risk, though most of the buildings in the area were wood frame houses. These homes are not easily affected by liquefaction and are at relatively low risk for damage in an earthquake. Specific mitigation strategies included determining community gathering areas, such as Ellensburg High School, and sending information about emergency preparedness, including making emergency kits and reinforcing weak parts of houses (eg. chimneys), to residents through utility bills. High-priority targets for further mitigation strategy development were identified, including the trailer park between Alder and University and Bloom Pavilion in the Fairgrounds."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Relocating Seismicity in the 2014?2015 Sheldon, Nevada Earthquake Swarm",Rebeca Becerra,Geological Sciences,"Since mid-July 2014, an earthquake swarm has been occurring in northwestern Nevada approximately 250 km north of Reno.  Seismicity rates in the swarm slowly increased over a four month span culminating in a number of mid-magnitude 4 earthquakes in early November 2014.   Since that time, seismicity rates have slowed and as of early April the swarm now totals over 4500 earthquakes.  The earthquake swarm is occurring in a region of the western Basin and Range that has seen very little historical seismicity, but is dominated by extensional features typical of the region.  Focal mechanisms for the largest earthquakes show normal faulting but hypocenters appear to be poorly aligned with local tectonic structures.  In order to assign these earthquakes to a regional structure, we relocated a total of 155 earthquakes using a joint hypocentral determination method.  For the six largest earthquakes, we manually picked absolute P and S wave arrival times.  In addition, we performed waveform cross-correlation on 153 earthquakes to get differential travel times.  We then performed a joint hypocentral determination using both of our absolute and relative travel time catalogs.  We find that the earthquake swarm is rupturing the normal faults bounding the western edge of the Sheldon Plateau.  In addition, we find many highly correlated waveforms from earthquakes spanning the duration of the earthquake swarm, suggesting that the same regions of the fault are rupturing repeatedly."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Mitigation Strategies for CWU and Surrounding Residential Areas,Amanda Huffstetler,Geological Sciences,"This project stemmed from the Douglas Honors Class Hazards, Risks, and Resilience in the Pacific Northwest that specifically looked at earthquakes and their impact on communities in that area. Ellensburg?s susceptibility and preparedness in the event of an earthquake was analyzed through visual data and survey analysis. To accomplish this, this group assessed the Central Washington University campus, and the areas north of University Way using Rapid Visual Screening (RVS) guidelines set out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Since the buildings surrounding campus are mostly stable, wood frame structures, CWU is the main concern of this poster. There is concern with older parts of campus because the brick structures have higher earthquake susceptibility. A web-based survey to learn about the community?s knowledge, experience, and preparedness for an earthquake was also created. 124 responses over a two-week period were recorded. This poster compared the total number of survey responses that fell within the area and whether or not they had an emergency kit prepared. The survey received a large proportion of responses from the 18-24 year old age range that implies oversampling of the student population. Mitigation strategies were proposed to develop community preparedness after the results were collected. We propose that there is an increase in student, faculty, and staff awareness of the current CWU Disaster Plan, and instructions on how to prepare an emergency kit for on campus housing. We also suggest annual flyers for off campus housing in this area about earthquake hazards. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Downtown Ellensburg and Surrounding Residential Areas,Anita Richards,Geological Sciences,"The purpose of our project was to add recommendations to the existing Federal Emergency Management Agency approved Kittitas County Hazard Mitigation Plan. This included hosting a survey for community members to participate in, as well as performing rapid visual screening around the city of Ellensburg, which involved viewing the structural stability of all homes and businesses from the street. Our group was assigned the greater downtown area of Ellensburg. After screening our area, we found that light-wood-frame residences would fare better than the unreinforced masonry buildings found in the commercial industry. In addition, we took into account the liquefaction zone in our area and how it places certain structures in potentially dangerous situations if a major seismic hazard were to occur. Most of our area was unaffected by the liquefaction zone, but we felt that it was important to educate Ellensburg residents about how to prepare for an earthquake on an individual level. Through our survey results, we found that the majority of people are not very concerned about earthquakes in Ellensburg. Taking this into account, we developed our poster to educate the public about potential hazards of living in houses with unreinforced chimneys, or the dangers posed by operating businesses in unreinforced masonry buildings. We recommended that people prepare emergency kits, develop a personal mitigation plan, and seismically retrofit their homes."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Public Knowledge of Earthquake Hazard and Perceptions of Risk and Preparedness in Ellensburg,David Hershfeldt,Sociology,"The possibility of earthquakes in the Kittitas Valley is a reality; however, how members of this community perceive this hazard, how much they know about earthquakes in general, and how prepared they feel in the event of a disaster is unclear. The Douglas Honors College course, ?Hazards, Risks, and Resilience in the Pacific Northwest? set out to find answers. The class conducted a community survey to address these concerns. The purpose was to gather information regarding the publics? knowledge, perception of risks and vulnerabilities, and the level of preparedness in the event of an earthquake in Ellensburg and Kittitas County. The online survey, available from 1/30-2/15, was conducted by asking citizens to participate and was shared via word of mouth, Daily Record newspaper, KLXE radio station, and a variety of social media sources. 124 responses were recorded in total. Earthquakes are not seen as highly likely as wildfires and floods and yet the feedback from the survey suggests that people would still experience some amount of vulnerability if an earthquake were to occur. Although many people have experienced an earthquake and believe them to be possible, only one third of the respondents knew the best way to respond to an earthquake, less than one half had emergency kits in their homes, and less than one third had an evacuation plan. The class created some suggested mitigation strategies that include creating opportunities for citizens of all ages to participate in earthquake drills, and encourage preparation of evacuation plans and emergency kits. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Analysis of Depositional Processes After the Columbia River Basalt Flows, Early Ellensburg Formation, Bettas Road, Ellensburg WA",Kassia Bennett,Geological Sciences,"The Columbia River Basalt (CRB) flows ~15 million years ago flattened the topography of central Washington, and altered the environments of existing river systems. The goal of our project is to understand how the local fluvial system responded to the CRB flows and eventually evolved into the environment we live in today by analyzing the laterally extensive outcrop at Bettas Road, which is an excellent example of sediment deposition immediately after a flood basalt event. Via hand sample and thin section analysis as well as published CRB flow maps, we confirmed that the base layer of the outcrop was of the Grande Ronde CRB flow, which indicates that the sediments deposited directly atop the basalt are the earliest of the Ellensburg Formation. We hypothesized that the first sediments deposited after the basalt would be fine-grained due to the unchannelized nature of the flattened topography, and that volcanic debris flows would dominantly be fine-grained and hyper-concentrated. We further predicted that as rivers developed channels, the grain size would become larger and the volcanic debris flows would be dominantly coarser-grained lahars. To test these hypotheses we mapped the 930-meter long outcrop, identified sedimentary facies, and performed grain-size analyses using a point-count method as well as sieves and a Mastersizer. Our results indicate that the grain size of both the fluvial and volcanic sediments generally coarsened upwards, as the fluvial system was not able to transport coarse-grained sediment immediately after the CRB flows but gradually evolved to transport larger material via mature channels.

Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Fluid Release from Eclogite and its Implications, North Qaidam Ultrahigh-Pressure Terrane, Western China",Jake Meyer,Geological Sciences,"Ultrahigh-pressure (UHP, depths ò100 km) eclogite samples from the North Qaidam terrane, Western China preserve evidence of significant H<sub>2</sub>O release along the pressure-temperature (P-T) path. Sample D126A (garnet + omphacite + zoisite + quartz + phengite) contains 500-600 æm garnet porphyroblasts, and 2-4 mm zoisite crystals. D126A garnet displays strong compositional zoning with decreasing Ca from core (Alm<sub>43</sub>Prp<sub>25</sub>Grs<sub>32</sub>) to rim (Alm<sub>45</sub>Prp<sub>28</sub>Grs<sub>27</sub>). Thermodynamic models of sample D126A determine a P-T path from the beginning of garnet core growth at ~368 øC and ~16 kbar to peak P-T conditions at ~675 øC and ~28.5 kbar. The predicted peak P-T conditions are consistent with published UHP conditions and are recorded in potential coesite pseudomorphs (UHP indicator mineral). These pseudomorphs are euhedral, tabular quartz inclusions found between the core and rim zones of garnet porphyroblasts in D126A. The whole rock H<sub>2</sub>O wt.% concentration in D126A decreases along the prograde P-T path, 5.17 to 0.50 wt.% H<sub>2</sub>O. The difference in H<sub>2</sub>O wt.% indicates that ~4.83 wt.% H<sub>2</sub>O would be released during prograde metamorphism. Based on the D126A thermodynamic model, H<sub>2</sub>O is released by the breakdown of hydrous minerals such as amphibole and lawsonite. Lawsonite breakdown and replacement is recorded as polycrystalline epidote inclusions within garnet porphyroblasts (present in another sample). These results quantify how much and where along a P-T path fluids are released from a subducting slab. These fluids are important because they trigger earthquakes and cause the mantle melting which feeds active volcanoes."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Pliocene ? Quaternary extension across the Volcanic Tableland and Black Mountain area, eastern California Shear Zone ",Kevin DeLano,Geological Sciences,"The San Andreas fault and the Walker Lane Belt (WLB) together form the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. A fundamental question in geology is how do faults in the WLB accommodate strike-slip motion between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates over space and time? To document the evolution of faults at a tectonic plate boundary, geologists compare present-day fault slip rates (geodetic studies) with geologic measurements of long-term slip rates (past ~0.1-5.0 million years). At latitude 37.5øN across the WLB, long-term slip rates sum to ~33% of the present-day slip rate. Nagorsen-Rinke et al. (2013) proposed that undocumented long-term fault slip explains part of this discrepancy. To test this model, I conducted new field geologic and LiDAR mapping, fault studies, and geochronology (determine the age of a rock) to calculate long-term fault slip rates across two areas: the Black Mountain and the Volcanic Tableland regions, eastern California. To calculate fault slip rates, I divide offset, a measure of the magnitude of displacement across faults, by the age of the displaced rock. In the Black Mountain area, fault slip rates are ò0.2 mm/yr since 3.5 million years (m. y.). In that time, faulting has horizontally extended the Earth?s crust by ~15%. In the Volcanic Tableland area, the fault slip rate is 0.1-0.2 mm/yr since 0.7 m.y. Since 0.7 m.y., faulting has horizontally extended the Earth?s crust ~0.8-1.6%. The style of faulting matches our prediction, but our preliminary fault slip rate estimates are slightly lower than hypothesized. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"8,000 Years of Sedimentation and Arroyo Formation, Hanson Creek, Yakima Training Center, Washington",Levi  Windingstad,Geological Sciences,"The causes and timing of cycles of sedimentation in the Hanson Creek drainage in central Washington provide insight into changes in channel morphology and paleoenvironment within the region over the last 8000 years. Using LiDAR imagery and field surveys, recent processes such as degree of modern channel incision, accumulation of valley floor sediment, channel morphology and gradient were evaluated. The spatial distribution of these channel characteristics was assessed in relation to proximal land forms such as spring mounds, colluvial deposits and basalt outcrops. Sixteen stratigraphic profiles in the arroyo walls were used to delineate and correlate past depositional episodes based on sediment characteristics. Basal ages of the earliest documented depositional period were constrained using geochemical analysis of tephra beds. Intermediate dates were obtained from 14C analysis of charcoal.  Stratigraphic evidence suggests multiple transitions from an aggrading braided system to an expansive, fine grained, alluvial step-pool sequence that aggraded a minimum of 3.5-m throughout the last 8000 years. Low gradient, fine grained, organic-rich, sediment suggests prolonged periods of saturation at three locations throughout the incised reach; adjacent to evidence of groundwater springs. The intervening reaches exhibit comparatively high gradients for unconsolidated alluvium. A single and unprecedented, 9-m deep incision of a 1.8-km reach occurred around AD 1900. The timing and physical environmental conditions associated with Holocene sedimentation in the Hanson Creek watershed will supplement the minimal data available on arroyo formation in the northwestern U.S., and allow a comparison with the timing of archaeological occupation sites adjacent to Hanson Creek."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Geological Mapping and Analysis of Red Mountain Fault, Owens Valley, California",Erik Larsen,Geological Sciences,"Fault scarps and offset landforms identified using GIS tools and techniques map and describe the Red Mountain Fault in Owens Valley, CA. The Red Mountain Fault (RMF) is a N-S-oriented, west-dipping normal fault that runs parallel to the right-lateral Owens Valley Fault (OVF). The fault scarps span 9.5 km, and are roughly continuous in the north, while the southernmost 3 km are segmented. The fault cuts ~100 ka alluvial fan deposits and 63-84 ka Crater Mountain Basalt, suggesting that all measured offset is younger than ~60 ka. Topographic profiles pulled from a lidar-derived DEM were exported into an Excel program that conducted Monte Carlo analysis to calculate offset by predicting the most likely result and computing the uncertainty. The amount of vertical offset ranges from 0.79 ñ 0.2 m to 7.31 ñ 0.3 m. There has been erosion of the fault scarp and sedimentary deposition on the hanging wall of the fault, so calculated offset values are considered minima. The largest offsets are in the central portion, decreasing towards the ends, a typical offset distribution along a normal fault. Determining the amount of offset and extension along the RMF can help us understand the Quaternary tectonics of Owens Valley, where strain appears to be partitioned between major right lateral faults like the OVF and smaller normal faults like the RMF."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Methods of Assessing Streamflow and Shallow Groundwater Interactions,Jacob Presher,Geological Sciences,"In recent years the importance of groundwater-surface water interactions to stream ecology has been increasingly recognized. Interactions between stream flow and hyporheic flow ?shallow groundwater connected to stream-water? are important to stream ecology by moderating surface-water temperatures, slowing down stream velocity, increasing nutrient residence times, and providing water to the ecosystem beyond the immediate area of the stream channel. The purpose of our research was to determine if and how stream restoration efforts impact interactions between stream flow and hyporheic flow. We collected stream stage and hyporheic potentiometric elevation data from sites in the Reecer Creek Floodplain Restoration project and an unrestored section of Reecer Creek. We installed a piezometer?a perforated hollow steel pipe ?to a depth of 1-2 feet in the stream substrate, and inserted a water pressure sensor within the piezometer. Comparing piezometer water depth to stream depth allowed us to determine the extent of the interaction between the stream and the groundwater within the hyporheic zone. Discharge of hyporheic flow to stream flow (upwelling) is indicated by a higher water level within the piezometer, while stream flow discharge to hyporheic flow (downwelling) is indicated by lower water levels in the piezometer. We predict more interaction between stream and hyporheic flow in restored reaches due to higher permeability of the stream bed, resulting from less silt and more gravel in the substrate. Ultimately we hope to determine if restoration efforts measurably improved stream flow interactions with the hyporheic zone, which directly affects stream ecology. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Identifying sediment and woody debris deposition following peak flows on the Elwha River WA,Ethan  Frenzel,Geological Sciences,"The purpose of this study is to identify relationships between peak flow, sediment redeposition, and woody debris transport on the Elwha River in western Washington during and following the removal of the Glines Canyon dam. Dam removal started on June 1, 2011 and was completed August 26, 2014.  We hypothesized that as portions of the Glines Canyon dam are removed the woody debris and sediment from behind the dam will create logjams, fill in existing bars, and decrease the average sediment size in the channel downstream. Our research was conducted 2-6 km downstream from the dam site. Sediment sizes were surveyed bimonthly and/or following large flood events at four sites during the study period. Surface sediment size was recorded every meter along a cross section for a minimum of 100m.  ArcGIS was used to map large woody debris and log jams on Mosaicked aerial photos of the entire study area, which allowed us to track the transportation of woody debris through the study reach after peak flows and dam removal stages. Woody debris below the Glines Canyon Dam generally increased during the study period. Sediment size initially rapidly decreased as cobble bars were buried by sand released from the reservoir, then increased slightly as the new sediment was reworked. This research will provide valuable information on sediment transport and river dynamics during and after dam removal, which is relevant for planning for the effects of future dam removal projects. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Willows and Soil Invertebrates at Reecer Creek, Ellensburg, WA",Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"We studied the changes over time in the riparian zone of the Reecer Creek Flood Plain Restoration Project in Ellensburg, WA, which is a stream restoration project constructed in 2011. We studied the populations of native vs. nonnative willows and the diversity of soil invertebrate species. We have documented the return of soil invertebrates to Reecer Creek and an establishment of volunteer native willows since 2011."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Reecer Creek Cross Sections and Stream Sedimentation,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"To visualize the change in the bed of Reecer Creek since the reconstruction of the riparian zone in 2011 we collected cross-sectional depth data from multiple sites in the restored zone. Combining past data from the same locations with the types and amount of sedimentation in the area, we were able to interpret how the creek has adapted to its new meandering course in the floodplain."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Reecer Creek Sediment Size and Embeddedness,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"The sediment particles in any given stream are a vital factor in determining the suitability of a given location for salmon habitats. The size of the sediment particles and how deeply they are buried in the streambed (embeddedness) in particular are major determining factors for redd survival. We took a random sample of sediment particle sizes and Embeddedness, and ultimately found that there are some midstream and upstream sites suitable for the construction of salmon redds, while the downstream location is uninhabitable."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Black Carbon Levels Within The Ellensburg Community,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"The Ellensburg High School AP Environmental class measured the concentration of black carbon throughout the community in winter 2015. Using an aethalometer we found black carbon levels both indoors and outdoors, at schools, and at public spaces. Understanding Black Carbon is important because it is composed of ultrafine particles which can contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as directly contributing to global warming."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Geographical Variations in Black Carbon around Ellensburg, WA",Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,Ellensburg High School AP Environmental class used a black carbon Aethalometer to record the concentration of black carbon in multiple locations around Ellensburg during the winter of 2015. We compared black carbon concentrations over both elevation and location. Black carbon is ultrafine particulate pollution that can be absorbed into the lungs and cause respiratory problems.
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Macro-Invertebrate & Water Quality Of Reecer Creek,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"We studied the Reecer Creek Restoration Project?s Ellensburg, Wash health through water quality testing and macro-invertebrate monitoring. Macro-invertebrate life can be correlated to the characteristics of the water in the creek by identifying indicator species. Additionally, the water quality of the stream would reveal the overall health. Many factors contribute to the quality of the water and macro invertebrate life"
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Building Better Burning Bubbles,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,The aim of our project is to design and evaluate a feasible offshore hydrogen generation plant off the coast of Washington State. Our plant will utilize existing offshore wind and wave generator technology to produce electricity that will power electrolysis. The purpose of the plant is to create a feasible hydrogen generation solution to allow for the phasing out of conventional gasoline. 
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Optimal Wetland for Ellensburg,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"We researched the carbon dioxide emissions and water pollution for our county, along with the methods and practices involved in constructing a wetland. We then looked at our local climate and geography to determine the ideal location to implement a resulting wetland that would sequester our produced greenhouse gas and purify our water. Our plan incorporated the calculated cost of installation and maintenance, and the long term benefits of the system."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Imagine Tomorrow Transportation,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"We will map the routes of each high school going to the Imagine Tomorrow Competition in Pullman, WA and use this to identify the best carpooling system. We will attempt to implement this solution for this year?s event. We will also document this process and explore reasons for resistance to carpooling to this event and in general. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Expanding Environmental  Awareness  in our Hispanic Community,Jeff Hashimoto,Ellensburg High School,"In 2014 we educated Hispanic families about the 3 R?s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) and documented their improvements.  In 2015, we want to educate more families about the 3 R?s and also about other ways they can reduce their resource use.  To broaden our reach, we plan to create a event in which we focus on children so they can spread the word with their parents and other adults.  We plan to teach about the 3 R?s AND other topics like energy use and how it will benefit our community environmentally and economically.

Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Real-time temperature sounding in Ellensburg,Iliass Tinedrebeogo,Computer Science,"The change of ambient temperature with height above ground is an indicator of atmospheric stability. Air quality forecasters need to know whether an air-shed is stable or not, as the dissipation of air pollution depends on this. while meteorological models predicts stability, a lack of vertical temperature measurements makes it difficult to ""ground truth"" such forecasts. We aim to make a real-time plotting of temperatures with height easily available via interfaces for all devices using the internet. Our contribution is a web dashboard application that monitors the real-time status of the temperature in regard of the height. We are able able to visualize temperature at each vertical height."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,An analysis on the Effects of Burn Severity on Organic Matter in the Snag Canyon Fire,Hannah Pygott,Environmental Studies,"Depending on severity, wildfires can slow forest regrowth, the more intense fires removing soil organic matter, in turn leaving the soil less fertile. We analyzed the effect of fire severity on soil organic matter and texture within the Snag Canyon Fire which was caused by lightning in extremely dry conditions in the summer of 2014. We hypothesized an inverse relationship between fire severity and soil organic matter in burned areas and a change in soil properties. We first analyzed satellite imagery to identify low, intermediate, and high intensity burned areas within the overall fire boundary. Next, we collected 30 soil samples from each burn severity to measure organic matter via mass lost on ignition. In addition, we conducted a soil texture test in the field to infer soil type. We found significantly less organic matter within the high burn severity zone compared to the low and intermediate burn severity zones (ANOVA, p-value<0.005). We also found that soil texture was coarser in the high burn severity area due to the lack of finer organic content compared to the area?s normal soil type. Our findings support the idea that fire severity can have significant effects on soil characteristics and organic content. This information is important for land managers focused on post-fire landscape rehabilitation and erosion control. Lastly, the satellite data did not accurately represent what we found in the field, which emphasizes that field work is required to ensure accuracy of burn severity analysis when using remotely sensed data."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Holocene fire history of the area surrounding Lemanasky Lake, eastern Cascades, Washington ",Grant Clifton,Geography,"Macroscopic charcoal analysis of lake sediments has been successfully used to reconstruct past fire patterns throughout the Pacific Northwest; however, there has been little research done on the forests of the eastern Cascades of Washington. This research reconstructs the fire history of Lemanasky Lake, WA (48.7øN, -119.6øW; elevation: 1088 m), located in the Cascade foothills near the Sinlahekin Wildlife Area, roughly five miles northwest of Tonasket, WA. The analysis of macroscopic charcoal from a five meter long sediment core provides a record of Holocene fire activity in the forest surrounding the lake. The primary research question addressed in this study is: ?How has fire activity changed at the study site during the Holocene, and what has been the cause of those changes?? In order to reconstruct the local fire history of the site, we counted all macroscopic charcoal particles >125 microns from contiguous 2 cm3 samples taken at 1 cm intervals. Our results suggest intentional fire suppression during the last ~100 years, which was preceded by frequent, low severity ground fires, with less fire activity prior to that. This reconstruction not only facilitates our understanding of changes in fire frequency and severity at the site as a result a past climatic variability, but more importantly shows how 20th century fire suppression has affected the forest. Additionally, the results may assist landowners within the wildlife-urban interface of Washington in implementing safe fire management practices."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Towards the Synthesis of Novel 1,3-Azaborines as Potential Hiv-1 Protease Inhibitors",Katherine Norris,Chemistry,"HIV-1 protease is an enzyme responsible for creating mature HIV viral particles. Recent studies have shown that boron-modified inhibitors have a higher affinity towards the protease than their corresponding non-boronated analogs and have inhibitory affinity towards an HIV-1 protease variant that is resistant to several HIV-1 protease inhibitors. The main goal of this research is to synthesize a library of both straight chain and cyclic boronates that potentially have dual-mode, competitive and associative, inhibitory action against HIV-1 protease, mimicking the transition state analog of the natural substrate and interfering with the viral life cycle. The borinic acid target compounds are chiral 1,3-azaborines that will potentially have a greater affinity towards the enzyme and better bioavailability, less toxicity, and fewer side effects than the currently used pharmaceuticals. Both straight chain and cyclic boronates are being synthesized which will serve to expand molecular diversity, as well as organoboron chemistry in general. Due to the structural rigidity of cyclic boronates, they are expected to be better inhibitors than their straight chain analogs."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Theoretical Study of the Flame Synthesis of the Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles,Kui Ting Lam,Chemistry,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles have been used for various applications in our daily lives. For example, the TiO2 nanoparticles are used in contaminant remediation, food coloring, coating for polymers, and photocatalysis. Dye-coated TiO2 nanoparticles help convert solar energy into electricity and are thus used in solar cells. While TiO2 nanoparticles have so many useful applications, the mechanism of the flame synthesis of the TiO2 nanoparticles is not well understood. In this research, we will study the chemical mechanism of the flame synthesis of the TiO2 nanoparticles. This mechanism involves various gas-phase and surface reactions between titanium species. Density functional theory methods will be used to model these reactions. In the end, we will be able to propose the mechanism of the flame synthesis of the TiO2 nanoparticles through the density functional theory calculations. The ultimate goal is to provide theoretical guidance on the size and surface control of the manufactured TiO2 nanoparticles. The benchmark coupled cluster calculations and 42 different DFT methods calculations using 6-311+G(d) basis set have been done in order to obtain reliable data for Ti-O-Cl species. Among the 42 DFT methods, B98 gives the best overall results to predict Ti-O-Cl species energies, geometries and vibrational frequencies."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Hydrogen Peroxide Production in the Presence of Soot and Biological Electron Donors,Jeff Barnes,Chemistry,"The detrimental effects of carbonaceous nanoparticles emitted from fuel combustion are well known, but their underlying chemical mechanisms are not.  Particle toxicity is generally thought to stem from the in vivo production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the details remain tenuous.  Here, experiments were carried out to investigate the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an ROS, as a function of soot characteristics and redox-active iron content in the presence of biological electron donors.  At biologically representative concentrations, results show that the presence of soot is essential in the continuous production of H2O2 at concentrations on the order of hundreds of nM and that a small redox-active pool of iron may be responsible for the conversion of H2O2 to a more potent ROS, hydroxyl radical (OH.).  Further investigation on the role of particle characteristics is underway.  Data from this study is likely to lead to a better understanding of the reactivity and transformation of carbonaceous particles in a variety of settings."

In recent years, air quality in Ellensburg has exceeded the national 24-hr average of 35 æg m-3 during winter months as well as during wild fire events, yet continuous air quality monitoring for the Ellensburg area is limited to a single monitoring site on top of the Hal Holmes Community Center.  The purpose of this Department of Ecology funded research was to further characterize the sources and geographic distribution of PM in Ellensburg during colder evenings in January through March of 2015.  To this end, three different types of instruments were placed in a vehicle and a set track of ~16 miles was driven five times over the course of one evening to obtain air quality data in the area.  Instruments consisted of two EPA approved portable nephelometers (for PM2.5), one aethelometer (for black carbon), and two microaethelometers (for personal monitoring of black carbon).  GIS mapping tools and statistical software programs will be used analyze the data geographically, temporally and comparatively to identify hotspots.  Results from this research will aid in understanding causes of poor air quality in Ellensburg and thus be used to mitigate against further deterioration of our air as well as to increase awareness of air quality issues in our community."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Manipulating the kinetics of methylene blue and phenol red in thin-film sol gel,Kelsey Miller,Chemistry,"The purpose of this experiment was to observe and manipulate the kinetics of methylene blue and phenol red in thin-film sol gel. Methylene blue is an oxygen indicator and can detect if it has been exposed to the atmosphere. Phenol red is a pH indicator and can detect a change in hydrogen ion concentration.Being able to change the reaction rate from instantaneous to a significant period of time has a wide range of implementations from biomedical to sensor applications. In order to alter the kinetics the two dyes were analyzed under several different reaction conditions. The methylene blue solution was altered by changing the ratio of methylene blue to Tin (II) Chloride. The phenol red solution was changed by altering the pH to neutral, basic and acidic conditions. The physical state of the sol-gel was also altered along with the dye/sol-gel ratio. The reaction rate of both dyes was determined by analyzing the solutions using ultra-violet visible spectroscopy. Ultra-violet visible spectroscopy was used to collect data of the change in absorption over the change in time. The data from the pH experiments showed no significant decrease in kinetics while the methylene blue system has controllable changes up to several hours."

Although the nature of demos are fun, these various phenomenon lead to a variety of serious hazards that must be well understood to perform in a safe manner. To ensure safety is our top priority, our club devised a 3-part demonstration standard operating procedure (demo-SOP) that includes (1) chemical preparation in the stockroom, (2) chemical presentation in front of the audience, and (3) differentiated learning that explains the demonstration at a K-8 or 9-12 level that align with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This 3-part demo-SOP provides an excellent quick guide for safely preparing and delivering the demo, the equipment needed, how to properly dispose of the chemical waste, and an age-appropriate explanation of the chemistry involved so that the performed demonstrations are as safe and informative as they are fun!?"
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Synthesis and Testing of Possible Antimicrobial Agents from Breakdown Products of Lasalocid A,Parker Wilson,Chemistry,"Increased antibiotic resistance has led to increased demand for new antibiotic development.  Completely synthetic libraries currently in production lack much of the structural complexity necessary for biological activity.  This research focuses on the synthesis of natural product-like compound libraries.  The products are derived from lasalocid, a naturally produced antibiotic primarily used as an additive in cow feed.  This parent material was selected for its large degree of structural complexity.  A Baeyer-Villiger oxidation will be performed to isolate the most complex portion of the molecule.  The functionality of this core scaffold will then be chemically modified.  The resulting chemical products will then be tested for antibiotic activity against several pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, the Gram-positive bacterial species responsible for staph infections, using a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay."

Huangshan, China",Gregory Fratellone,Biological Sciences,"As a socially well-connected and cohesive species, humans tend to make many collective decisions. How do nonhuman species collectively relay information? We present data on the leadership of collective movements in Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) in Mt. Huangshan, China by analyzing their movements in relation to their social networks. All-occurrence sampling was used to investigate collective movement patterns, and focal and scan sampling were used to retrieve information on their affiliative and agonistic behaviors for a complete social network analysis. There were a total of 128 successful collective movements recorded over a two-month period. All 20 adult individuals participated in collective movement leadership. There was no significant effect of sex, age or rank on the leadership frequency of adult troop members. However, the highest-ranking female (YH) and a young female (TXX) significantly led more collective movements than expected by chance. The strength and eigenvector centrality of affiliative and agonistic social networks were significantly correlated with collective movement. Both females belong to different clusters in the social network analysis of collective movement, meaning that certain individuals tend to move with one female or the other. Individuals belonging to these two clusters may be a consequence of the mating season. An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests. Supported by NSFC (30970414 & 31172106) and NSF-OISE (1065589)."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Seasonality as a Mediator of Range Use and Feeding Behavior on the Parasite Richness of the Saddleback Tamarins,Krista Banda,Biological Sciences,"This study aims to investigate which intestinal parasites are found in the Peruvian Amazon?s tamarins and how seasonality influences parasite richness and prevalence. Previous studies have shown a positive trend between moist environments and numbers of intestinal parasite. The mantled howler monkeys of Costa Rica living in La Selva, a wetter habitat, had greater intestinal parasite infections than their counterparts at La Pacifica, a drier habitat. Unlike howler monkeys, tamarins are smaller primates and must engage in a foraging strategy called traplining that requires them to gather small amounts of food in many places along a long route. Tamarins have large home ranges, between 30-120 hectares, relative to their body size. Peruvian seasonal changes may inhibit range use and feeding ecologies. It can affect what vegetation is available and the density of insects found in a given habitat. This study focuses on the degree to which seasonality mediates the relationships between feeding behavior and parasite richness found in saddleback tamarins in the Los Amigos Field Site in Puerto Maldonado, Peru. Fecal samples will be collected in collaboration with Field Projects International from the populations (n = 4) and labeled with their individual ID number, sex, approximate age, date of collection, time of collection,  and collector. I will follow groups of tamarins noting the feeding behaviors along with their GPS coordinates. Fecal samples will be collected, read, and analyzed using fecal flotation, fecal sedimentation, and PCR in the Parker Lab in the University of Madison - St. Louis."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Effects of Immune Serum on Macrophage Infection with <i>Leshmania</i>,Mercedes Cheslock,Biological Sciences,"Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by single-celled parasites in the genus <i>Leishmania</i>. Over 20 different species of <i>Leishmania</i > infect humans, with several occurring within the same geographical area. The disease is spread when an infected sand fly feeds on a susceptible mammalian host. <i>Leishmania</i> parasites are injected into the mammalian host during a blood meal; upon entry into the body, the parasites infect white blood cells, macrophages. Leishmaniasis symptoms vary and may elicit: no symptoms, skin sores, weight loss, fever, internal organ enlargement, or death depending on the species of parasite and susceptibility of the host. Previous experiments have shown that the susceptible BALB/c mouse, infected with a low dose of cutaneous <i>L. major</i> and challenged with <i>L. infantum</i> develop exacerbated disease with higher parasite burden relative to na‹ve mice. The immune response generated to <i>L. infantum</i> had little notable difference between <i>L. major</i> exposed and na‹ve mice.  Cross-reactive antibodies were noted in both groups regardless of immune history. The present study focuses on the role of cross-reactive antibodies in uptake of <i>Leishmania</i> parasites by macrophages using immune serum containing antibodies. A mouse macrophage cell line was exposed to <i>Leishmania</i> parasites and either control serum or <i>L. major</i>-infected serum.  Cells were exposed to parasites and serum for 24, 48, or 72 hours and then stained to visualize internal parasites.  This study aims to reveal if preexisting antibodies to one species of <i>Leishmania</i> leads to the disease exacerbation seen upon exposure to a different species."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Insect Communities: Ellensburg Upstream vs Downstream Sites,Michael Balda,Biological Sciences,"Urban stream syndrome occurs when an urban area affects a stream system. Stream burial is common in urban systems, and burial blocks incoming light, potentially affecting available food resources and in turn affecting the insect communities. I tested for changes to the stream ecosystem as a result of urbanization by measuring insect community parameters upstream and downstream of buried sites in the three creeks in Ellensburg, WA that are affected by urban stream syndrome. I measured chlorophyll on rocks, total suspended sediments (TSS), fine benthic organic matter (FBOM), ammonium, and phosphorus to relate to insect commuinities characteristics. I hypothesize that there is an overall significant difference between insect communities in the upstream and downstream sites. Each creek is tested at two sites, with an upstream and a downstream testing location, totaling twelve sample sites. I am looking at this difference in comparing upstream vs downstream sites. To find the significance of the data, a paired t-test is used to find any significance between the upstream and the dowenstream sites. I found no significant difference in chlorophyll, FBOM or TSS between the upstream and downstream sites (p = 0.92, p = 0.47 and p = 0.50 respectively).  However, I found higher phosphorus concentrations upstream of a buried stream segment compared to downstream (p = 0.048) implying net phosphorus uptake in the buried reach. The identification of the individual insects within their respected communities will show whether or not burial is affecting these communities. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Rapid detection of E. coli using flow cytometry immunofluorescence,Clinton Elg,Biological Sciences,"The bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 poses a public health threat as demonstrated in a Washington state lake-associated swimming outbreak that hospitalized eight children in 1999 and the recent outbreak on Mercer Island that closed schools and restaurants for nearly one week as residents boiled drinking water due to contamination. Current methodology of testing for pathogenic bacteria in surface water relies on counting all fecal coliform bacteria with no specificity for pathogenic strains, which are rarely enumerated as the typical laboratory requires three days to positively identify pathogenic E. coli O157:H7. I am developing a flow cytometer assay for rapid (<30 min) detection of E. coli O157:H7 from natural waterways (i.e., streams, lakes, ponds) at detection levels suitable for application to public safety. To date, I have used fluorescent tagged E. coli O157:H7 antibodies (immunofluorescence) to detect the pathogen via flow cytometry in heterogeneous natural stream samples in less than 20 minutes and am incorporating use of a second fluorescent dye to differentiate organic matter from nonorganic debris in mixed water samples to lower the E. coli O157:H7 detection threshold. The ability of this novel flow cytometry assay to speed detection of E. coli O157:H7 from days to minutes holds the potential to protect public health in recreational waters. It also has potential application for use in rapid diagnoses of E. coli O157:H7 in human feces, protection of drinking water quality, and the prevention of food borne illness."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Effects of Light on ¤-Catechin?s Inhibition of Idaho Fescue?s Root Growth,Sarah Clark,Biological Sciences,"Spotted Knapweed (<i>Centaurea stoebe</i>), a common invasive plant in the Pacific Northwest, produces the racemic chemical ñ-Catechin. Current research suggests that ñ-Catechin inhibits root growth in Idaho Fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>), a common native bunch grass. These findings suggest that competition between these two species results in a negative fitness and diminished ecological success of Idaho Fescue. This phenomenon of one species? chemical exudate affecting another species fitness is known as allelopathy. Current allelopathic research is conducted in the dark to highlight any differential growth between control and experimental groups due to the over-expression of gibberellin hormones resulting in etiolation. It is difficult to simulate environmental conditions completely, and it is unknown if energy input through photosynthesis would affect ñ-Catechin?s inhibition of Idaho Fescue root elongation. Therefore, we will investigate if ñ-Catechin?s allelopathic effects are mitigated by the input of energy by replicating previous ñ-Catechin research under similar conditions and using light as the experimental variable. Using germination paper, three replicates of one hundred-twenty Idaho Fescue seeds that will be placed into rows and grown in solutions of (ñ)-Catechin at concentrations of 20 ppm. After two weeks, root length will be analyzed for significant differences between these experiments in the light and previous experiments conducted in the dark. Results of this research will be invaluable in understanding the ecological interactions of Spotted Knapweed on native plants and help current research more accurately replicate environmental conditions in a laboratory setting."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Seasonal Nutrient Limitation in Taneum Creek, Washington",Tyler Alling,Biological Sciences,"Two key determinants of stream ecosystem productivity are algal activity, the source of primary production of energy in a food web from solar radiation via photosynthesis, and heterotrophic activity, the bacterial and fungal consumers of this primary ecosystem production. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations often determine ecosystem productivity, and varying nutrient levels exist within an ecosystem seasonally. For example, during the fall leaf input decomposes, possibly leading to different nutrient levels compared to winter, when few leaves remain in the stream. This variation can be applied to higher trophic levels via bottom up ecosystem production whereby increased primary production increases production at higher trophic levels such as fish. We used nutrient diffusing substrata to measure seasonal changes in ecosystem nutrient limitation in two sites in Taneum Creek, which has been of interest to the Yakama Nation due to their active migratory fish repopulation efforts. In the fall we found that heterotrophic activity in Taneum Creek was co-limited by N and P at both study sites (p=0.006 upstream, p<0.001 downstream) whereas autotrophic activity was not nutrient limited. In the winter, upstream heterotrophic and downstream autotrophic production were co-limited by N and P (p=0.007, p=0.019 respectively), but autotrophic productivity upstream and heterotrophic activity downstream was not nutrient limited. This study will continue in spring and summer for a comprehensive analysis of limiting factors to autotrophic and heterotrophic activity, which will form a better understanding of ecosystem productivity to support fisheries reintroduction."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"C. elegans, as a model to study the effects of the antidepressant, escitalopram, on behavior.",Tykayah Baird,Biological Sciences,"Depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders in the world, and the use of antidepressant drugs to help with the effects associated with depression, continues to rise.  Depression is associated with low levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the neuronal synapses of the brain.  Escitalopram (Brand name Lexapro) is an widely used antidepressant and functions as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which increases levels of 5-HT at the synapse. While the acute effects of escitalopram are known, the effects of long-term use of escitalopram, which results in continuous elevation of 5-HT, have not yet been fully studied. We have chosen the roundworm, C. elegans as a model to examine the long-term effects of escitalopram treatment. Acute 5-HT treatment slows locomotion in worm. Upon chronic 5-HT treatment the worm will recover their speeds back to levels similar to that of untreated animals, this is a behavior termed adaptation.  In C. elegans, food serves as a stimulus that releases 5-HT into the synapses of the worm causing them to slow; escitalopram enhances this slowing on food, which is expected of a drug that inhibits reuptake of 5-HT. We have begun studies to examine whether or not the chronic or long-term treatment of escitalopram also causes adaptation.  In addition, we will test mutant worms that are defective in adaptation to 5-HT to see if they are also defective in adaptation to escitalopram.  These studies could provide insight into the genes involved in cellular pathways that could be linked to depression."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Effects of Excess Testosterone on 129S1 Mouse Adipose Tissues,Raegan Nelson,Biological Sciences,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 8-10% of women at reproductive age. It is believed a combination of PCOS symptoms such as increased testosterone levels, weight gain, and polycystic ovaries may contribute to reduced fertility. The etiology of PCOS is poorly understood in women and ethical constraints limit the ability to study the syndrome. One way PCOS can be studied is using mice models. This study investigates the effect of excess dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a testosterone analog, in 129S1/SViMJ mice. The 129S1 strain is a common inbred mouse strain used for biomedical research. Mice were treated with DHT using a 90 day continuous release pellet, after which tissue samples were collected, sectioned, and stained using the hematoxylin and eosin technique. Examined adipose tissues included brown, inguinal, retinoperitineal, and gonadal fat. Quantitative analysis shows that DHT treated mice had significantly increased body weights than placebo mice. Qualitative analysis suggests increased cell sizes in DHT treated inguinal, retinoperitineal, and gonadal adipose tissues compared to placebo tissues. DHT treated brown adipose tissues appear to have larger lipid droplets than placebo tissues, rather than larger cell sizes. This preliminary data may explain the increased weight of DHT treated mice and support the 129S1 mouse strain as a PCOS model. Quantitative analysis is currently underway to examine adipose tissue changes and how they may pertain to women with PCOS. Future research will examine 129S1 mice ovaries in placebo and DHT treated mice for polycystic ovaries often present in women with PCOS."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Effect of Testosterone on Gene Expression in White and Brown Adipose Tissue,Courtney Simianer,Biological Sciences,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a disease characterized by high levels of testosterone; it affects 1 in 3 women in their reproductive age. Non-obese diabetic mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to induce PCOS-like symptoms. Symptoms of PCOS include excess testosterone, polycystic ovaries, and/or increased weight gain. There was an increase in the body weight among the DHT treated mice over the course of the study. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the four different types of adipose tissues demonstrated an increase in adipocyte cell size when treated with DHT. Additionally, there was a morphological change in the brown adipose tissue observed after DHT treatment. The brown adipose tissue in DHT treated mice resembled white adipose tissue, suggesting the cells may have differentiated. The purpose of this current study is to determine whether the DHT treatment causes alteration of gene expression in the brown adipose tissue, so that it expresses genes typically expressed in white adipose tissue. Research is currently underway to determine the differences in gene expression, using RNA isolated from the four different types of adipose tissues collected. The RNA is then converted to cDNA in order to quantitate the level of gene expression using real-time PCR. The expression of several genes including, Rbp-4, Fabp-4, Ucp-1, and Glut-1 was examined. This project may provide insight as to why women with PCOS have a higher chance of developing metabolic dysfunction. "

In this experiment the effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on female C57Bl/6 mice were observed in retroperitoneal, inguinal, gonadal and brown adipose tissue as well as uterine tissue. For a twelve-week period each mouse was either untreated or treated with DHT through a pellet inserted under the skin. The weight of each mouse was measured weekly. After twelve weeks the mice were euthanized and adipose and uterine tissue samples were removed and embedded in paraffin wax. The tissues were then sectioned, and stained using a hemotoxylin and eosin staining protocol.  The weight of the DHT mice were significantly higher than the weight of the untreated mice, suggesting that excess DHT causes an increase in body weight for C57BL/6 mice. We hypothesize that DHT treated mice will have larger adipose cells and altered uterine tissue compared to the untreated mice. The difference in cell size for each tissue was examined and we observed that the brown and inguinal fat cells of the DHT mice to be qualitatively larger compared to the untreated cells. Preliminary results suggest there may be a difference in the number of uterine glands between the two treatment groups. This experiment aims to achieve a better understanding of the effects of DHT on the body mass and reproductive cycle of mice to gain a better understanding in relation to PCOS."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Observing the effects of novel flavonoid Malheuran-2 on MCF-7 cells using flow cytometric analysis,Dean Hoffer,Biological Sciences,"Apoptosis is the mechanism used to regulate the balance between cell proliferation and cell death.  Reduced levels of apoptosis, or increased levels of proliferation can lead to regions of uncontrollable growth, or cancer.  Flavonoids are being studied because of their anti-tumor qualities and low toxicity on surrounding healthy tissue. Of six flavonoids extracted from the Dalea searlsiae plant, flavonoids 1-4 showed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells.  After further studying the effects of flavonoid 2, apoptosis was confirmed using fluorescent microscopy and staining with Annexin V Alexa fluor 488 and propidium iodide.  Analysis using flow cytometry was impossible due to false binding of Annexin which was attributed to harsh cell harvesting techniques compromising the cell membrane and surface proteins."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Substrate temperature preference in Pygmy short-horned lizards (Phrynosoma douglasii),Elizabeth  Rathburn,Biological Sciences,"Lizards, as ectotherms, rely on external heat sources such as solar radiation, substrate temperature, and air temperature to regulate body temperature using common behaviors such as shuttling, basking, and burrowing into the substrate. Few studies have been done to observe thermoregulation in the pygmy short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglasii), which inhabits eastern Washington State. During this study, lizards were captured from the Quilomene Recreation Area near Vantage, Washington. To observe thermoregulatory responses we placed the lizards in an artificial enclosure (the ?ectothermatron?), which contains a sandy substrate, wooden shelters, as well as food and water. The ectothermatron contains heating elements and cooling coils to create a thermal gradient from approximately ~11-50 øC and timed lighting to simulate natural photoperiod. We measured body-surface and substrate temperatures with an infrared thermometer every hour between 0900h and 1300h from mid-April to mid-May 2014. We hypothesized that P. douglasii would (1) select relatively high temperatures, (2) , prefer lower temperatures at night, and (3) would show more burrowing behavior into substrate than use of shelters.  Phrynosoma douglasii actively thermoregulated maintaining, for example, an average body temperature of 35.8ñ0.8øC at 1400h but only 22.5ñ1.4øC at 2100h. Substrate usage also differed throughout the 24-hour period with lizards on the surface for 83% at 1400h but only 6.3% at 2100h. . We conclude that P. douglasii actively thermoregulates, preferring higher substrate temperatures during the day than at night and frequently burrows at night. Future studies could investigate whether photoperiod or temperature factors influence burrowing behavior in P. douglasii. "

The concern for contamination of local streams and rivers represents an important local issue that sits at the crossroads of science, community health, politics and the rural lifestyle. Previous research projects have found that fecal coliform levels of Wilson Creek are three times higher in Ellensburg than they are in the water surrounding town, with in-town levels dangerously exceeding surface water quality standards as set forth in Washington state law. The focus of this research was to find the location and source of coliform bacteria making its way into Wilson Creek in Ellensburg. Sample sites were established along Wilson Creek from September to November 2014 where biweekly standardized water sample tests were performed. Total coliform counts from the various sample sites have narrowed the suspected input source to a two block stretch of Wilson Creek. A drop in the coliform level following the cessation of irrigation water flow suggest the source of contamination is the nearby canal. Continuing research has isolated several strains of coliform bacteria from the creek, tested them for antibacterial resistance, and attempted to identify the species of bacteria. This research is taking place in conjunction with city water management specialists and represents a joint effort between the City of Ellensburg and the biology department at CWU to protect public health by identifying and eliminating sources of dangerous bacteria in local surface waterways."

On the surface this seems like a good idea, but recent research indicates that folic acid may unintentionally accelerate existing breast and other cancerous growth in a subset of the human population, potentially affecting cancer patients, survivors, and postmenopausal women. Preliminary research conducted to assess a possible relationship between folic acid concentration and human breast cancer growth was inconclusive due to not including normal cells as a comparison group in the initial study. We hypothesized that folic acid may have differential effects on normal vs breast cancer cell growth rate, viability, and morphology. To emulate folic acid exposure nationally, including those individuals with pre-existing cancer, we conducted follow up experiments comparing folic acid effects on MCF-7 human breast cancer and CHO ovarian cell lines. Results showed a decrease in human breast cancer viability and growth rate as folic acid concentrations increased, while CHO cells viability and growth rate increased."

This parasitic nematode feeds on human blood upon reaching the small intestine. Previous studies have confirmed resistance to available drugs, rendering it necessary to develop new treatments. Although necessary, research and production of possible treatments has been neglected in the past because drug development for impoverished areas does not result in a sufficient amount of profit.  Earlier projects within Dr. Dondji?s lab have shown that plant natural products cause mortality of adult hookworm ex vivo. The plants Dalea ornata, Oemlaria cerasiformis, and Eucalyptus globulus have already shown efficacy; adult worms have demonstrated either significant decreases in motility or an increase in mortality. Now, the active components of the plants extracts that are effective must be identified. The goal of this project is to assess the anthelminthic effects of natural plant extracts for activity against Ancylostoma ceylanicum in the animal model host, the Syrian Hamster. If an effective fraction is discovered, identifying the active ingredients of the fraction and testing their anthelminthic effects can help develop new potential control tools to help reduce the health burden that results from soil-transmitted nematodes such as, Ancylostoma ceylanicum."

The bright and contrasting colors warn possible predators of distasteful and even poisonous compounds. The recognition of such warning signals has been shown within mammals, fishes, and reptiles (both avian and non-avian). For our study, we examined the efficacy of such possible warning coloration in a small, cryptic species of snake, the Ring-neck Snake (Diadophis punctatus). Ring-neck Snakes are a trans-continental species that average less than 70 cm total length. Within the western United States they are strongly associated with oak-pine woodland, and along riparian zones in semi-arid habitats. When discovered by possible predators, Ring-neck Snakes are well known for revealing vibrant yellow or orange bellies, and for an upward curling of the bright red ventral surface of the tail. For our experiment we used 6 types of clay models. The first 3 were green with alternating patterns of dots (no dots, single, or double row). The other type of model was bright orange with this same pattern of dots.  Models (246) were placed in appropriate habitat where several species of birds may see them. After 4-6 days, models were gathered and scored for bite marks. Once scored, percentage of bit marks for each model type was found. The percentages for the green models with varying patterns of dots are as follows: no dot 34.6%, single row 27.1%, and double row 32.3%. The percentages for the orange models with varying patterns of dots are as follows: no dot 2.3%, single row 0.8%, and double row 3%. This data shows a greater percentage of bite marks in green models compared to orange models, pointing to the conclusion that there is avian recognition of aposematic warning coloration in D. Punctatus. "

Candidate asteroids were chosen to have relatively short rotational periods, and magnitude variations of 0.25 or greater.  Using the 30 cm telescope on the roof of Lind Hall at Central Washington University, photometric data was obtained for the asteroid 382 Dodona for approximately five rotational periods over the course of four clear nights.

Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Using entangled photons for single photon interference,Nathan Zimmerer,Physics,"Entangled photons, and single photon interference are prime examples of quantum mechanics and are useful in evaluating the theory. To find entangled photons, an apparatus was built, and optimized, that used heralded detection. The apparatus produced entangled photons using a pump laser producing 474 nm radiation, and a á-Barium Borate(BBO) crystal. The entangled 948 nm photons were produced in two separate beams arbitrarily known as signal and idler photons. Each beam was detected by an avalanche photodiode (APD). When the signal photons reached the APD, electronic pulses were produced and sent through a delay line, while electronic pulses from the idler photon APD were not. Then the pulses from the APDs were used as a start and stop for a time-to-amplitude converter (TAC). A multichannel analyzer was used to evaluate the TAC spectrum, and showed a large amount of coincidences at time intervals consistent with that of the delayed signal pulses. These coincidences provide evidence that the apparatus was producing entangled photons. After the apparatus was optimized, a double slit was placed in the path of the signal photons, and used to search for heralded single photon interference. The results were inconclusive within measurement uncertainty."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Creating Entangled Photons by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion,Blake Savisky,Physics,"The purpose of this project is to set up a system for creating entangled photon pairs for use in various quantum mechanical experiments, including the testing of Bell?s inequalities which demonstrates the fundamentally indeterministic nature of quantum mechanics. The photons are created by pumping a beta barium borate crystal with 405nm laser light, then due to a process called type 1 spontaneous parametric down conversion a single pump photon can be converted into two 810nm photons in an entangled state. In the same lab a similar set up has already been achieved using a 474nm pump laser, but by using a shorter wave length a higher detection rate can be achieved. Two collimators are set up to collect the down converted photons and send them to two photon counting modules. The collimators need to be positioned precisely to detect any down converted photons because they emerge from the crystal in a narrow beam that is at an angle with respect to the pump beam and only a miniscule fraction of pump photons are down converted. The angle at which the down converted photons emerge is a function of how the crystal is prepared and the polarization orientation of the pump beam and was calculated using a program by NIST."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Growth Cone Mechanics,William North,Physics,"A nerve growth cone is a mechanical structure that responds to chemical signals in order to guide axon growth during nervous system development. We developed a computational model to explore the underlying mechanics of a nerve growth cone inside a fetus, and to specifically address the question of how the mechanical components of the growth cone work together to allow the cone to steer in response to external chemical signals. By developing a deeper understanding of the bio-physics of growth cones, we hope to contribute to a broader understanding of how the nervous system develops. Based on experimental observations of the movement and components of a growth cone, we wrote a computational program in Matlab using differential equations to explain the mechanics of how a growth cone moves and turns. We hypothesize that the growth cone operates through a mechanical ?clutch? mechanism in which a group of filaments called f-actin act as the engine-clutch system and a group of filaments called microtubules provide the steering. Theoretical predictions of our model could be tested by future experiments, in order to test the validity of our hypothesis. This project has helped further research on growth cone dynamics and functions and this has given me a deeper understanding of doing research with the use of computational analysis."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Tracking Molecular Motors along Microtubules,Daniel Griffin,Physics,"An axon is a long narrow fiber that extends away from a nerve cell body and makes contact with other cells. In addition to serving as the ?wire? for transmission of electrical signals from the nerve, the axon also provides a pathway for transport of molecular-scale cargo (such as mitochondria, lipids, proteins, and other organelles) to and from the nerve cell. Molecules called molecular motors carry cargo along a dense bundle of long parallel filaments inside the axon. We are interested in understanding the physical mechanism molecular motors use to transport cargo over long distances in the axon, and the role this plays in nervous system development. Our collaborators Prof. Peter Baas and Anand Rao at Drexel University used FRAP (Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) microscopy to produce time-lapse movies of the movement of short microtubules along an axon. My research is to analyze the movement of the microtubules in an attempt to understand how the molecular motors transport them. Using the program ImageJ with the plug-in TrackMate, I can take the experimental images and analyze the microtubule?s movements over a time period. The plug-in TrackMate works by using detectors, filters and other parameters to identify bright spots in the image corresponding to an object, and tracking these bright spots from one frame to the next. This research may someday lead to innovations in Alzheimer?s disease and cancer because with knowing how the motors are supposed to move, one can locate those that move irregularly."

Research with far infrared lasers has a range of applications including terahertz imaging, a form of noninvasive imaging. Creating a catalog of far-infrared laser emissions is also beneficial for their use in high-resolution spectroscopic investigations of stable molecules and short-lived free radicals. The purpose of this research was to measure the frequencies of known far-infrared laser emissions generated by <sup>13</sup>CD<sub>3</sub>OD, an isotopic form of methanol. This was achieved using an optically pumped molecular laser and two carbon dioxide reference lasers. In this work, the frequencies for 16 far-infrared laser emissions have been measured with a one-sigma uncertainty of approximately 0.7 MHz. This poster will cover the experimental procedure used for this research along with the data that was recorded."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Investigating the Correlation between Inclination of Coronal Loops and Solar Flare Activity,John-Paul Mann,Physics,"The purpose of this research is to investigate changes in the coronal loop structures during the life cycle of a solar flare.  Coronal loops are intricate and complicated magnetic features on the solar surface that are the source of large solar flares.  Understanding the dynamics of these coronal loops provides better models for predicting solar flare activity. By obtaining the magnetogram, or magnetic field strength, along with the inclination of these coronal loops the full structure of the coronal loop can be obtained.  Therefore, we studied how the coronal loops inclination angle, as it emerges from the photosphere, changes in response to variations to the magnetic field strength. Research data was used from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO).  Helioviewer, an online application, was used as a visual database for active region selection. Numerical data was then collected for each active region through the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) online by Stanford.  Python coding language was implemented in order to manipulate these large data sets and images for multiple different solar active regions.  A baseline for the relationship between magnetogram strength and inclination angle of a coronal loop was obtained by investigation of multiple active regions where no solar flares were present. Then two active regions with multiple large X-class solar flares were investigated for magnetogram strength vs. inclination angle over time.  These differences in inclination for the solar flare active regions vs. the baseline active region are still being investigated."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Origin of a Cosmic Ring in NGC 7538,Jason Arakawa,Physics,"NGC 7538 is a high mass star forming region about 8800 light years away. In this region, stars are being born, beginning from a large collapsing dust cloud. After the formation of the star, the burning of hydrogen in the core through nuclear fusion produces photons that outflow and exert pressure, called radiation pressure, on the gas and dust surrounding the star, forming a bubble of empty space. The research will investigated an elliptical gas ring in NGC 7538, similar to these bubbles, though whose source is unknown as it doesn?t have a star in the center. This research investigated if a runaway star could have formed in or passed through the center of the ring region previously, initialized the expansion of the ring, then moved out of the region. A program was written to plot stars around the ring in three dimensions, and from the stars plotted so far, there have not been any stars that intersected the ring in the past. We will continue to consider more stars from more databases to determine if a runaway star did intersect the ring in the past. "
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Predicting Solar Sigmoid Lifetimes based on Shearing in the Photosphere,Austen Stone,Physics,"This project?s purpose was to study how the speed at which the plasma in the photosphere of the Sun affects the lifetime and shape of a solar sigmoid. Solar sigmoids are S-shaped, twisted magnetic structures that are due to the shifting magnetic field lines emerging from the surface of the sun. The photosphere is the visible layer of the Sun?s surface and is made up of cells of plasma that are highly conductive and influenced by the magnetic field of the Sun. Sigmoids form when shearing (a lateral shift between two objects in directions opposite each other) occurs in the photosphere plasma, causing ropes of magnetic flux to break and reconnect in S shapes. I predicted that when higher velocity shearing occurs in this plasma, solar sigmoid structures will be stretched out and as a result be less stable, extending just above the surface of the Sun, and at a lower shearing velocity a sigmoid will stay stable longer and be able to extend much further above the surface of the sun. The shear velocity of the photosphere at the base of the sigmoid was measured using the physics based Tracker software, which takes user uploaded videos and helps measure changes in position of an object within the video. This project was carried out using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to retrieve magnetogram time lapse data and both partial and full solar view time-lapse data.

Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Spherical Shell Resonance and Applications as a Model for the Human Skull,Adam Tangocci,Physics,"Previous research performed by students and faculty at CWU has shown that changing pressure inside a spherical aluminum shell can shift the resonance frequencies of the shell. This property may be applied to the human skull and allow for a non-invasive method of measuring of intracranial pressure. To more closely resemble the environmental conditions of the human skull, a new mount was used with a smaller point of contact at the base of the sphere and the change in pressure compared to previous experiments was decreased by at least an order of magnitude (from over 40 psi to less than 1 psi). Expected frequency shifts due to the smaller pressure changes are less than .0001%, therefore extensive testing was done to quantify and identify sources of experimental uncertainty. Results indicate that the current experimental design cannot produce reliable measurements of such small frequency shifts. Specific sources of uncertainty and possible improvements to the experimental design will be discussed."
Mar. 13th 8:30-11:00 a.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Experimental Investigation of Nonlinear Wave Behavior in a Tensegrity Mast,Joy Westland,Physics,"Tensegrity structures are made up of load-bearing elements (rods) and tension-bearing elements (cables) held together in static equilibrium via a balanced distribution of compression and tension. First conceived in the mid-20th century, tensegrity structures have been analyzed and studied by mathematicians, civil and aeronautic engineers, and biophysicists, among others, generally with the goal of understanding static behavior. The focus of this study is the dynamic properties of a tensegrity structure when acting as medium for longitudinal and torsional vibrational waves. The first phase consists of the construction of the tensegrity tower while the second phase is to measure and characterize the wave pulses that propagate through the tower. This presentation will focus on the process of constructing a tensegrity tower through various methods. The approach to building the tower involves creating sections of the tower and then uniting them. Using aluminum rods connected by strings, the tower is formed with overlapping structural units (layers) of three rods each. The primary challenge has been to control the amount of tension within the strings of the tower in order to create the balanced ratio between the rods and strings. Other challenges involve working with small scale hardware to tighten or loosen the structure to maintain equilibrium. Future experiments on the completed tower will investigate nonlinear wave behavior when compressional and torsional wave pulses are propagating through the structure. "

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Effects of Acoustics on Music Performances and Recordings,Katie Shelton,Music,"As a musician and flutist, I have had many opportunities to perform, attend live performances, and listen to recordings of performances. I have found that I have been both pleased and displeased with both live and recorded performances in terms of overall sound quality of the music and how clearly musical details including articulations, dynamics, and clarity are perceived. Architectural acoustic studies date back to ancient Greece when the philosopher Vitruvius designed the outdoor amphitheater that would send sound upward to the audience members. Some of the first music written for organ sounds best when performed in cathedrals with reverberant stone walls and high ceilings. Today, concert halls built for orchestras are designed to have ?wet? acoustics, meaning that the building allows for sound to reverberate. Desirable venues for jazz bands have dry acoustics, with little to no sound reverberation, allowing for amplification and electronic enhancement of the sound. Ultimately, one of the most important skills for a musician to develop is the ability to effectively communicate with their audiences. I would like to discover the ideal venues for me as a ?classical? performer as I play and record my flute. I will learn a piece for unaccompanied flute that I can play and record in a variety of venues. This will allow me to evaluate how different musical characteristics sound during performance and on a recording in each of the venues. I will chose venues with a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and materials. I will document the presence and absence of people, objects, and extraneous noise in the room, and will document my evaluations on the clarity of my live performances and recordings of the piece. "

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Subtleties of Soda,Amanda Bury,Art,"Soda firing is an atmospheric ceramic firing process during which soda (usually consisting of sodium bi-carbonate, also known as soda ash) is introduced into the kiln near peak temperature. Soda ash is most commonly mixed with hot water and sprayed directly into the kiln. Once subjected to the heat of the kiln, it vaporizes and bonds with the surfaces of the pots to form a sodium-silicate glaze. The award of the C. Farrell Scholarship in Spring 2014 and Fall 2014 provided the funds necessary to build a new wood-burning soda kiln and the opportunity for exploration and research of this firing method. The newly constructed kiln, located within the ceramics facilities on the Central Washington University Ellensburg campus, was built during Spring of 2014. During the Fall of 2014 investigation of this this new type of firing technique and how utilitarian vessels lend their form to this process was conducted. The culmination of the award period ended in an exhibition featuring my utilitarian work that is representational of the soda-fired aesthetic. This construction and research provided me with beneficial exploration in areas of kiln construction and the utilization of the aesthetics of soda firing, creating a foundation of knowledge about applying those surface aesthetics to current and future artwork."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Revitalizing CWU's Largest Art Collection: New Photographics,Skyler Crady,Art,"New Photographics was a nationally known photography exhibition held at Central Washington University. Organized by the late CWU emeritus Jim Sahlstrand, the show ran from the early 70?s to the late 80?s. During its time, New Photographics was an anticipated event for photographers across the nation and for the CWU Art Department, where it was hosted in the Sarah Spurgeon Gallery. In the late 80?s the exhibition fizzled out and has ceased to reemerge. Since then, an enormous amount of documents and artwork has been stored in a small room in Randall hall and has rarely been touched since. During this quarter I am taking an Independent Study with current CWU photography professor, Allyson Klutenkamper to learn more about the New Photographics show and collection. With the help of Professor Klutenkamper, the Art Selection Committee and CWU alumni, I will be researching, documenting, and re-archiving the compilation so that CWU?s largest art collection can be reintroduced into the art community and hopefully become an active part of it.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Common Star,Emma Mahr,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of my design was to create the perfect garment a woman on the go could wear from running errands to a spring walk in the park. The touches of gold in the sleeves and pants cuffs represent stars peeking out of the night sky, which is also mirrored in the depths of the blue bodice and black pants. PROCESS: During the creation process, I started with a pair of capris pants. For the top, I wanted something that would have some flow as the model walked. I decided to have flowing sleeves. After I made the sleeves gold, I thought it would also be a nice coordinating touch to add the same gold fabric on the cuff of the pants. TECHNIQUES: The bodice was created by draping muslin on a dress form, then making patterns from the completed draping. The pants were made by flat patterning, a process involving taking the model?s specific leg measurements, completing specific mathematical calculations, and precisely drawing out the pant pattern directly on paper. After all the patterns were made, samples were created and fit on my model. Adjustments were made from the fitting and the final garments was constructed. The bodice is fully lined with an invisible zipper and the pants include a facing along the top and an invisible zipper. INNOVATION: The conservative neckline and pant length makes it perfect for a wide variety of body types. The coordinating gold fabric for the sleeves and pant cuffs makes the garments perfect to be worn together, but also separates that could be worn with other garments making them very versatile. MATERIALS: polyester fabric, invisible zippers, polyester thread.  This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30th at 3pm and 7pm in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,SHE?S AWAKENED- RELEASE,Alissa Leach,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the design is to show the desire of a woman through her sexuality while also following her belief of modesty. This is a woman with a lot of creativity and elegance, she wants to show every unique side to her. I wanted to challenge my design abilities by doing a garment I have not done before. Using a slippery fabric and a fitted top it gave the garment the class, elegance, and sex appeal I desired. The colors show the creative side of her while the flow gives her elegance. PROCESS: Before beginning the sketches for my designs, images were collected for inspiration and design elements. The inspiration was primarily photos of Muslim women, who are often viewed as oppressed, but these photos show the creativity in which they have control over their fashion. To me this represented strong women who are fun and creative while still being able to practice modesty for their beliefs. In order to show a modest look while giving a little sex appeal I chose to gather the skirt at the waist using a lot of fabric while keeping a slit up to show the leg while she?s walking. Not only fashions and prints were inspiration but also architecture and colors of the Middle East including Mosques as well as Jewish Temples across Israel and Lebanon. TECHNIQUES: Draping and flat patterning methods were used to create this garment. The top of the dress is flat patterned then altered to fit the models bust. While the skirt is solely draped at the waist then cut for each panel, then the front seam was left partially opened up the leg. The materials include 1 ¬ yards of the top skirt sheer organza fabric as well as for the black sheer lining fabric underneath. There is a half a yard of the top woven fabric used as well as for the neck and armhole facings. CONTRIBUTION TO FASHION: With a lot of playful colors and lines giving a feminine look to the garments as well as an architectural and geometric design element that shows strength in the look as well. The flow of the skirt with the high slit shows boldness while the movement gives elegance. MATERIALS: woven fabric, zipper, interfacing, polyester thread.  This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30th at 3pm and 7pm in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,VIVIDO DESSE ,Andrea Eklund,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this design was to integrate various apparel construction techniques used throughout history in one creative garment. PROCESS: Inspiration for the design came from recent trips to Paris, London, and Milan.  My imagination was sparked while I was engrossed in the stories and images of these historical cities were people have lived their lives and fashion evolved over hundreds of years.  Drawing inspiration from a boat ride down the Seine River in Paris and the miles-long network of canals, the monuments and carvings at Westminster Abbey, the Wedding Dress 1775-2014 exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum and many other historical locations the cut, proportion and details of the garment came into fruition.  Graffiti seen throughout Paris and Milan along with the stained glass windows and vivid colors at Westminster Abbey was the inspiration for the unique textile design on the garment which is meant to stimulate thought and emotion. A simple leotard was created to go underneath the garment as to cover the body but not take away from the over garment. TECHNIQUES: Creating the front bodice of small even pleats was a long and precise process. The size, placement and angle of the pleats was detailed work to assure that they fit over the chest correctly and would open up beyond the chest so the viewer could clearly see the textile design.   Once the pleated fabric was sewn together it was carefully drawn on to create the unique textile design. The dramatic ruff was created using traditional methods and was practiced a few times to assure the final product was accurate, clean and balanced. CONTRIBUTION: Combining the draping, pleating, neck ruff, bold textile art and specific details the garment has a unique and unseen design combination and aesthetic to contribute to the design community. MATERIALS: 100% plain weave fabric, polyester thread, leather, fabric paint"
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Lily of the Valley,Rachael Wescott,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this garment is to bring wonderment, beauty, and imagination back into our lives. When we were young, princesses, fairies, and mermaids were an everyday occurrence and they brought daydreams and joy. This garment shows that even as an adult, a woman can put on a fairytalesque dress and be in her own world of beautiful scenery, singing songbirds and her own Prince Charming. This dress is for dreamers who go after their bliss and don?t let anything stop them. Every woman is beautiful in her own wonderful way, and this dress is suited for any woman who knows her true beauty and wants to show it to the world. PROCESS: During the design process of this project wedding dress designers were reviewed and future bridal trends were analyzed. This dress resembles more of a bridesmaid dress, because prints are becoming particularly popular among bridesmaids, especially watercolor and floral prints. I chose to do a strapless bridesmaid-like dress because most bridesmaids? dresses have straps, while most wedding dresses are strapless and I wanted to do a switching of dress design roles. TECHNIQUE: This dress was created using the draping technique. Fabric was draped over a dress form and then pattern was created from the draping. A sample garment was made from the pattern and fittings on model were done in order to create a proper fit. Once the fit was correct final alternations to the pattern were made and the final garment was created. The garment is lined and has an invisible zipper and features flowing fabric for the skirt and a silk bodice. INNOVATION: The innovation of this design is the bias cut bodice that includes unique triangular shapes that form a unique silhouette on the wearer. By incorporating these design lines the woman wearing the garment can feel unique and beautiful, in a style and dress all her own. MATERIALS: 100% Polyester , 100% Silk, 100% Cotton, invisible zipper, polyester thread, hem tape.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,It Girl ,Lauren Abrams,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose for this garment was to create a piece of clothing that a woman can wear out to a formal or social event. I wanted to make the wearer feel confidant and sexy, but at the same time showing her fun side. The off-shoulder strap creates a sexy and confidant look and the handmade roses show the fun and romantic side of the woman. Having a bold purple color shows a more fun and confidant woman.  PROCESS: The process of this garment started with my interests. I love roses and I wanted to do something with them, I looked on Pinterest for ideals and what I could do with my interest of roses. I started sketching and it took a few tries to get the perfect dress, after that I measured my model and started draping. Once the draping was done I then started pattering the draped garment. After flat pattering I can began to create my sample garment. With the sample garment I fitted it on my model to see if there is any adjustments I need to make. Adjustments were made to the pattern form the fitting. The finish garment was then sewn together and roses were hand sew on as a final touch to the garment.  TECHNIQUES: The techniques I used to make this garment were draping. The bodice was draped by using the princess line technique. The pattern for the skirt was a flare skirt draping technique. I used French seams to assure the inside of the garment looks as clean and tidy as the outside. The straps were cut on the bias to have more stretch for ease of movement. Making the roses and applying them to the final garment was a tedious and detail oriented process.  INNOVATION: The innovation of this garment is the three dimensional texture and how it expresses the fun and confidence of the woman wearing the dress.  MATERIALS: cotton fabric, polyester, a sipper, and purple treads. This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30th at 3pm and 7pm in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Sweet Goddess,Karina  Villasenor,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: Through designing this garment I wanted to challenge myself through advancing my sewing skills to create a garment that makes the wearer feel beautiful. PROCESS: When I first started to design my garment I did a lot of research on Pinterest for inspiration.  Japanese fashion is a particular interest of mine and was inspired by many of the up and coming street styles that are currently being reported on along with designs by Atsusi Nakshime. Going through many sketches I finally decided on this garment you see before you featuring a corset, which was a challenge to construct properly. TECHNIQUES: Draping was used to create this garment. From the draping a pattern was made and from the pattern a sample was constructed.  The sample was put on my model and final changes were made from the fitting to the paper patter.  Once this was done I was able to cut my final fabric and carefully make my final garment. CONTRIBUTION TO FASHION: It contributes to fashion by deifying the beauty of female deity. By making a good appearance making the young women feel younger and confident. MATERIALS: polyester satin fabric, polyester sheer plain weave fabric, plain weave lining, zipper, polyester thread.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Lucid Dream,Malissa Clark,Family and Consumer Sciences,"Purpose: The purpose of this design was to create a garment that is beautiful but also practical. The look is inspired by grunge but also by romanticism and the occult. I wanted to portray a completely simplistic garment in a way that makes it seem so much more profound and adaptable to any style the wearer chooses to portray. Process: I found my initial inspiration by looking at Dark Beauty Magazine, a gothic fashion magazine.  From there I searched on various online databases and put inspirational images into a design Pinterest board. The images combined created a tribal but celestial mood, with an otherworldly etherealness. After I had the mood concrete, I began looking to my favorite clothing websites like Dolls Kill and Nasty Gal to decide what kind of garment I might want to construct. These websites have out of the norm looks and an overall grunge, alternative feel, while still accommodating to many style tribes. All of this considered, I decided to create a romper with a tied back and small ruffle details on the shoulders and bottom hem. Techniques: To make this design a reality, I used flat patterning and draping to create a pattern. From the pattern I made a sample, which I then fitted to my model.  Once the fit was perfected I created the final garment which you see today. Contribution to fashion or innovation used: My contribution to fashion is the creation of a piece of clothing that can seamlessly adapt to many different style tribes. Materials: Lightweight gray cotton fabric, all-purpose thread, invisible zipper. This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30th at 3pm and 7pm in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Wanderlust,Kaylee Harris,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of my design is to create a look that is simple and easy to wear while still being superbly unique and daring. My ultimate goal was to create a garment to be worn in a festival setting where there are no rules or boundaries according to dress and personal style. I wanted to create something that would stand out in a crowd and still be wearable and flattering. PROCESS: The process of designing this piece was really quite simple. I knew I wanted to have a basic and flattering silhouette, which I achieved with a slightly flared skirt, but I wanted there to be drama to the piece, which I incorporated with a plunging neckline and low cut back. The drama of my garment is the tie dyed pattern, which I created by hand. I knew at the beginning of my designing process that I wanted to have something that really stood out and was unique in comparison to anything else that will be seen on the runway. I hope to achieve that with my one-of-a-kind dyed fabric. TECHNIQUES: Draping was used to create this garment. Once I completed the drape I adjusted the pattern to give the skirt a larger flare to achieve more fullness and volume. A challenge I ran into was the absence of a dress form with similar measurements to my model, so I had to rely on the fittings with my model to create a truly custom-fitted garment. This process is more time consuming but it gave the dress a more accurate fit and thus an overall more flattering look. CONTRIBUTION: Tie dying is not only pretty to look at, but it is a bonding experience between friends and even with oneself, because creating something, especially art, is a soul gratifying experience. I hope to bring personal creativity back into the picture of fashion and show people that you don?t have to have the same exact thing as the next person in order to be fashionable, but rather be completely and truly yourself.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,After Death,D'ondre Johnson,Family and Consumer Sciences,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this design was to compose a minimalist ready-to-wear garment. PROCESS: The process of this design began with extensive design development. Design development began with inspiration of several Christian Dior and Saint Laurent past designs along with other inspirational images. TECHNIQUES: Draping was used to design the garment. Fabric was draped on a dress form and manipulated into the design. Darts were placed on the front and back bodices for proper fitting.  Once the final look via draping was achieved the muslin was removed and the design was translated to paper patterns. A sample was made from the patterns and a fit on the model.  Final changes to the pattern from the fitting were made and then the final fabric was then sewed together to complete construction of design. INNOVATION:Simplification of design provides an alternative outlook to traditional outlooks. MATERIALS: silk, wool, and cotton fabrics, polyester yarn, and invisible zipper. This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30th at 3pm and 7pm in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall."

The purpose of the mural is to bring awareness to the garden by creating a welcoming space that empowers the community to learn from, work with and teach others. As a group, we became involved with the Campus Community Garden through HED 450 Community Organization and Coalition Development. The purpose of this course is to provide public health students the knowledge, practices, and skills necessary to be successful while working with community organizations. We started out developing a concept to attract more CWU students to be a part of the garden through participating in a design competition for the garden?s mural. Submitted designs from CWU students are currently being considered for final selection during the month of April. The chosen artist will be asked to recreate the drawing on a plywood panel for a Community Mural Painting event which will be held on the first Friday in May and open for all community members to participate in. Our role in this project was to collaborate in launching of the mural design competition, engaging local businesses to contribute resources to the mural project, and participate in the Community Painting Event in May. Our service learning project also involved several opportunities for academic reflection on this experience, and we plan to highlight some of our reflection pieces as well as photos from the design process and the actual garden space in our SOURCE presentation.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Trends in Youth Drug Behavior in Guam,Jennifer McCutchen,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","As a U.S. territory, the island of Guam is home to 159,358 individuals, including adolescents and young adults. Drug activity among Guamanian youth has increased considerably over the last 20 years. The purpose of this study is to examine trends in drug-related activities and behaviors among adolescents on the island of Guam, using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) public data set. Participating in drug use, sale, or other distribution during adolescence has been associated with declining grades, dropping out of high school, patterns of criminal activity, and both physical and mental health conditions, making it a concerning public health issue.  The 2013 CDC High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey shows that 41% of youth in Guam reported being offered, sold or given an illegal drug at school; this is double the national average (CDC, 2015). While we have seen the national average going down since 2001, the rates in Guam have increased by 14% since 2001 and despite these concerning statistics, very little evidence exists to suggest why the burden of illegal drug sale or distribution on school property is higher in Guam than in other U.S. states and territories. We will explore both school-based and other related drug behaviors reported by the YRBSS dataset from 1995 ? 2013. This study is a preliminary effort to a larger study of drug perceptions among youth that will take place in Guam as a part of a faculty-mentored research experience in Summer 2015, partially funded by the Office of Undergraduate Research."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Environmental Perceptions of Central Washington University Students,Cris  Morton,"Physical Education, School & Public Health","Sustainability is becoming more important in our culture, with industry and governments working to reduce their environmental impact by instituting ?green initiatives,? such as utilizing renewable energy or expanding recycling programs. For Central Washington University (CWU) to consider, implement, and continue new green initiatives, support from the student body is vital. However, there is currently no clear picture of how the student body perceives the importance of environmental issues, or how much it is willing to support the institution of green initiatives by volunteering time or donating money. We sent a six-question survey to the CWU student body to gain a better understanding of their perception of and support for green initiatives. Anonymity of respondents was ensured by omitting demographic questions and limiting access to survey data. The Qualtrics-based survey was sent twice to every CWU student email address through CPORT, which compiled the responses and created cross-tabulations for analysis. Responses indicate that most students are interested in environmental issues, feel that it is important for CWU to institute green initiatives, and are willing to pay to institute those initiatives. Results also showed that many students are more likely to attend a university that implements green initiatives, but CWU has lacked initiative to institute sustainable policies, or develop a culture of participation in sustainable practices. Our survey suggests that instituting green initiatives would improve the university?s marketability to prospective students, and that students would financially support those green initiatives. "

This research is important because it highlights areas in which health education is lacking and provides suggestions on how to address these issues. The purpose of the research was to assess the health education program present in the migrant community living in the Vista Hermosa community at the Broetje Orchards in Prescott, WA and to compare it to other migrant and agricultural communities. The Vista Hermosa Community is a unique case study because the Broetje family established this community for their migrant workers in 1988. Along with supplying housing, the family also provides a schooling system, daycare and a health education program for their employees. The public health committee was established in hopes of increasing the availability of health education materials available to the community.  The public health committee and members of the Broetje family were interviewed to assess the current health education available in the Vista Hermosa Community. Over half of the community has attended either one or both of the previous health fairs offered by the public health committee, thus it is important to consider the content and scope of education materials provided for participants.

To explore the effect of a comprehensive cancer rehabilitation program on biopsychosocial measures and, 2. To determine if biopsychosocial outcomes are related to initial fitness values. Research has examined the relationship between participation in physical activity and improvement in quality of life in cancer survivors. Additionally, it has been established that initial fitness level of healthy adults effects the magnitude of improvement after aerobic exercise training however, it is unclear in older adults, and cancer survivors. The evaluation of the potential relationship between initial fitness levels and biopsychosocial response has not been explored in healthy or clinical populations. Fifty-one post-treatment cancer survivors of all cancer types were assigned to the treatment group in a pre-post quasi-experimental design. The 12-week comprehensive rehabilitation program consisted of two 90-minute sessions per week. Each session was comprised of three components: an educational activity, cardiovascular training, and strength and flexibility training. Dependent measures included: aerobic capacity, body fat %, handgrip strength, quality of life, Schwartz Fatigue Scale, and the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale (LASA). A Two-way Analysis of Variance demonstrated no differences between the two levels of fitness. A paired t-test revealed statistically significant differences pre- and post-program among all dependent variables with the exception of nonsignificant findings of anxiety and anger LASA scale measures. Overall, a comprehensive rehabilitation program for cancer survivors improves biopsychosocial outcomes and is not influenced by the participant?s initial fitness level. "

SLS research is equivocal on the effects of sway over time and the direction of balance initiation. Sway data in a healthy young population may provide insight on how balance is initiated and maintained in relation to the initial step direction. This may lead to novel approaches to help healthy elderly populations decrease fall risk and fall-related mortality. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the temporal and directional dependencies of sway parameters during 10 seconds of SLS in young, healthy adults. Methods: Six healthy, young college students (5 male, 1 female) performed 10 seconds of SLS on their dominant leg, stepping from a frontward and sideward direction. Ground reaction forces measured with a force platform were used to calculate the sway parameters: sway area, sway velocity, anterior-posterior and medio-lateral sway, and sway path. Preliminary Results: Compared to the final second, the sway area, path and velocities were significantly higher in second 1 and 2 in the forward and sideward directions. Anterior-posterior sway was lower during second 1 and 2 in the forward direction. Medio-lateral sway was higher in second 2 in the forward direction, and lower at second 1, 2, and 4 in the sideward direction."

Interestingly, no studies have investigated the physiological responses of performing HIIE in a water medium. Thus, the main question of this investigation was the following: What is the physiological load imposed on the human body during an acute SW-HIIE session?  Physically active females (N=9; 26+6 yrs) volunteered for this descriptive study. Volunteers performed a familiarization trial, an incremental maximal shallow water exercise test, and a SW-HIIE session. Participants were submerged to ~75% of stature (axillary level).  SW-HIIE consisted of 4 X 4 minute segments with one minute recovery in between. Each segment consisted of 8 X 20 seconds of maximal physical effort with 10 seconds of rest between each effort.  Indirect calorimetry (Parvo-Medic metabolic analyzer) was employed to assess metabolic response and heart rate was monitored via telemetry (Polar technology).  SW-HIIE elicited an overall oxygen uptake response of 2.0+0.2 lO2.min-1 (73+5% of peak aerobic capacity), nearly 8 times above resting metabolic rate, while overall heart rate (HR) response was 156+8 bpm (86+2% HR peak). In conclusion, the SW-HIIE session elicited cardiorespiratory responses that would be classified as ?vigorous? on the intensity scale according to the American College of Sports Medicine?s guidelines for exercise prescription, suggesting that an acute bout of SW-HIIE imposes a great physiological load on the human body.

One solution to this problem is the substitution of high fat ingredients such as butter and oil with lower fat options in baked goods. This study examined the acceptability of non-fat yogurt and applesauce as butter replacements in brownies. Statistical analyses indicated that the applesauce and yogurt recipes were significantly different from the control in several sensory and objective tests, and were generally less acceptable (p<0.05). Two sensory testing sessions gathered data from 51 total judges.  The judges rated moistness, sourness, and chewiness specifically, for each variation. The results showed a significant difference in chewiness and sourness between the three variations, however no significant difference in moistness. Objective tests, using a TA.XT2 Texture Analyzer, indicated that the yogurt and applesauce variations took significantly more force to penetrate and withdraw than the control. Our results therefore determined that applesauce and yogurt were not equivalent full-fat substitutes for butter in brownies.

To combat this, individuals can consume food products that make fiber claims to increase their intake to the recommended 25 grams per day. One fiber claim a company can make if a product contains at least 2.5 grams of fiber per serving is that it is a good source of fiber. This experiment, conducted in February of 2015, aimed to increase fiber consumption by creating a ?good source of fiber? muffin without altering the taste. To do this, part of the whole wheat and all-purpose flour in the recipe were replaced with one of three International Fiber Corporation fiber powders. The powders used were White Wheat Fiber (WWF), Powdered Cellulose (FFC) and Cotton Seed (BVF). No significant differences (p<0.05) were subjectively determined between any of the three fibers compared to the control (BVF n=32, WWF n=32, FFC n=60). Objective testing (p>0.05, n=18 for all tests/muffin types) showed a significant difference in mean penetration force between the control muffins compared to all three variable muffin types. Adding white whole wheat fiber and cotton seed fiber resulted in a softer muffin than the control, while powdered cellulose resulted in a harder muffin. There were no significant differences (p<0.05, n=18 for all tests/muffin types) in percent moisture content and mean withdrawal force between the variable muffins and the control muffins. Therefore, one can conclude that all three fibers create acceptable replacement muffins that are a good source of fiber."

Specific populations such as vegans and vegetarians may find consuming recommended amounts of protein from the diet challenging. Therefore, the addition of alternative sources of protein in baked goods was the primary focus in this study. Pea Powder Protein Isolate from the dry yellow pea was utilized. Pumpkin Spice Muffins were manipulated to contain various amounts of Pea Powder Protein to create a ?good source? of protein and an ?excellent source? of protein in addition to a control containing no added protein. Data was collected to determine if an identifiable change in physical properties existed as a result of the added protein. Data for the sensory and objective tests were evaluated using ANOVA, Tukey?s LSD and Chi-Squared Analysis. 59 judges provided sensory data. Results of the sensory tests for Pumpkin Flavor Intensity, Tenderness, Moistness and Preference indicated the Pumpkin Spice Muffin prepared as a ?good source? of protein was an acceptable product compared to the control. Objective data for Cone Penetration Force, Moisture Content, Muffin Height and Density Index indicated although the moisture content was greater in the muffins prepared as a ?good source? and ?excellent source? of protein, the control was the most tender. It can be concluded a Pumpkin Spice Muffin prepared as a ?good source? of protein using the Pea Powder Protein is an acceptable product, while the Pumpkin Spice Muffin prepared as an ?excellent source? of protein is not."

To address this problem, three types of gluten-free scone formulations were baked with varying amounts of konjac glucomannan (control: 0 g konjac; low: 20.0 g konjac; high: 40.0 g konjac), tested with a sensory analysis session (extended triangle difference tests and preference test), and underwent objective testing (% moisture, compression force, and penetration force). A random sample of 28 Central Washington University students volunteered for the sensory analysis session. The extended triangle difference tests were analyzed using a triangle test, difference analysis chart1. And from this test the results showed that no significant difference was found between the three types of scones. The results from all objective tests were analyzed using ANOVA. It was also revealed that the control scones had significantly higher % moisture than the low and high konjac formulations. The average penetration force of the control scone was significantly lower than that of the high konjac formulation. No significant differences were found in compression force among the three formulations. These results suggests that successful dietary fiber fortification with konjac glucomannon in gluten free baked products can be accomplished."

METHODS:  Male and female participants (n = 21, 33 ñ 10.5 yr, 173.1 cm; mass, 70.7 ñ 11.0 kg) were examined during a one- hour hot hatha yoga class (38.7 ñ 2.6 øC, 36 ñ 13% relative humidity).  Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured to assess pre-exercise hydration status.  Sweat rate was calculated using pre and post session weight and fluid intake.  Sweat sodium concentration was analyzed via a sweat patch sample.  After the hot yoga session, participants were asked to fill an empty 1-liter container with the amount of water with which they perceived they lost as sweat during the class.  A paired t test was used to identify significance between measured sweat loss and perceived sweat loss and Pearson?s correlation analyses were used to asses any relationship between selected variables (p ó 0.05).  RESULTS:  76% of participants began hot yoga euhydrated (USG < 1.020).  Sweat rate was 0.9 ñ 0.6 Lúh-1, and despite free access to fluids during class, consumption was low (0.2 ñ 0.2 Lúh-1) and 33% did not consume any fluids.  Consequently, mean percent body mass loss was 0.9 ñ 0.6% from pre-exercise body mass, and about half of the participants lost at least 1% of body mass.  There was a significant difference between perception of sweat loss and measured loss (p = 0.01).  Mean sweat sodium concentration was 49.1 ñ 19.2 mmolúL-1.     CONCLUSION:  These findings highlight the individual variability in hydration management among hot yoga participants.  Therefore, a need for personalized hydration guidelines and individual education is warranted to prevent hypohydration.

Limited research is available regarding the current nutrient intake of SCI elite athletes, possible nutrient deficiencies and geographical consumption patterns. The purpose of this study was to examine the diets of (n=12) Canadian (CAN) and (n=27) American (USA) elite athletes with SCI from the US Paralympic Canadian Sport Institute utilizing a self-reported 24 hour diet recall. Nutrient inadequacy was estimated by the proportion of athletes with mean intakes below the estimated average requirement (EAR) using the Research Solutions Food Processor Diet Analysis Software (ESHA). Mean energy intakes were 1,603 +/- 855 kcal for women and 1906 +/- 756 kcal for men. Reported micronutrient intakes were below EAR in >60% of USA athletes for Vitamin D, Folate, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium and Zinc, while 60% of CAN athletes reported intakes below the EAR in Niacin, B6, B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Folate, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Potassium and Zinc.  In conclusion, nutrient intakes below the EAR were consistently found for both groups of elite athletes with SCI and suggested similar nutrient insufficiencies. Further research is needed to examine nutrient intake using other methods of dietary assessment and to determine the factors that may lead to nutrient insufficiency among elite athletes with SCI.  "
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Whole body fuel use: a preliminary study of carbohydrate and fat oxidation during water exercise ,Heather  Gerrish,"Nutrition, Exercise & Health Science","The purpose of this investigation was to measure energy expenditure and whole body carbohydrate and fat oxidation during shallow water exercise (SWE; submerged to axillary level).  The level of energy expenditure and the relative contribution of fuels (e.g. carbohydrate (CHO), fat) depends on the intensity of exercise effort. This descriptive study addressed several questions: (1) what is the energy expenditure of performing SWE over a range of intensities, and (2) how does the rate of CHO and fat usage change with increasingly more demanding SWE efforts. Five healthy females (age, 18?26 years) performed five submaximal and one maximal SWE bout based on perceived effort (Borg Scale). Indirect calorimetry (Parvo-Medic metabolic analyzer) was employed to assess metabolic response while heart rate (HR) was monitored via telemetry (Polar technology).  For perception of efforts ranging from very light (~50% HR peak) to very hard (~88% HR peak) the rate of energy expenditure ranged from 3.5+0.7 to 10.5+1.3 kilocalories per minute (Kcal.min-1), while the maximal SWE effort elicited a metabolic response of 13.2+1.7 Kcal.min-1 (~ 10 X resting metabolic rate). From very light to very hard, the rate of CHO oxidation increased from 2.0+1.0 to 9.4+1.8 Kcal.min-1 (~370% increase), while fat oxidation remained variable among the SWE efforts. In conclusion, carbohydrate oxidation plays an increasingly more important role as a fuel source during SWE efforts that require a high rate of energy expenditure.  Furthermore, this study provides insight into the energy requirements of SWE, a mode of exercise that is becoming more popular."

In order to improve the nutritional quality of the NSLP, standards for government subsidized school lunches changed in July 2012 under the Healthy Hunger-free Kids Act of 2010(HHFKA). In Spring of 2012, digital photographs of NSLP lunches were taken before and after meal consumption in four elementary schools, prior to enactment of HHFKA. In Spring of 2013, after enactment of the HHFKA, digital photographs of lunch were again taken in the same schools. The photos were used to make estimates of nutritional content of meals selected and consumed. Comparison between the pre-HHFKA meals and the post-HHFKA meals revealed significant differences between the 2012 and 2013 mean nutrient content selected and consumed for food energy, total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, protein, calcium, fiber, cholesterol, sodium, and vitamin C.  Saturated fat & sodium selection was significantly different: Saturated Fat: 6.1 grams (2012); 3.5 grams (2013); Sodium: 1148 mg (2012); 909 mg (2013), p<.05.  No significant differences between 2012 and 2013 mean nutrient content selected and consumed for iron, and vitamin A were found.

This study examines the impact of diet on iron intake in adolescent female cross country runners. Animal-based iron sources are recognized as being better absorbed and more bioavailable than non-animal-based sources. Additionally, vitamin C promotes iron absorption. In this study the independent variable was defined as a vegetarian diet (one excluding meat, fish, and poultry), with the control being a non-vegetarian diet. The hypothesis was that vegetarian cross country runners would have lower mean iron intakes than non-vegetarians. Data were collected via a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and a 3-Day Diet Log (3DL) provided to the subjects. Scores based on servings per week were assigned to the FFQ to create an estimate of each subject's daily iron and vitamin C intake. 3DLs were analyzed using ESHA Research Solutions Food Processor Diet Analysis software to form a representative picture of various nutrients over time, with the primary focus on iron and vitamin C. Permutation tests were used to analyze the dietary data. No significant differences in average iron intake or other key nutrients were found to exist between groups for 3DL data. A commonly attended running camp during the administration of this study may have been a factor. Analysis of the FFQ dietary data, indicating longer term intakes, revealed vegetarians had statistically significant higher intakes of vitamin C (p = 0.0389) and iron (p = 0.0135) than non-vegetarians."

Diets high in fat or sugar, and/or low in fruits, vegetables, are considered to be at a higher risk for obesity-related chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the third leading cause of death in Guam compared to seventh for the U.S. overall. Additionally, the majority of youth in Guam report inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Due to the increased risk in this population, it is critical for research to identify behavioral strategies that may effectively reduce risk through low-risk dietary interventions. Participants included eight females and seven males, aged 9 to 13 years, and were recruited from Guam Youth Summer camps. The sample represented mainly Asian/Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, and White/Caucasian populations. Anthropometric and descriptive dietary data were obtained through food frequency questionnaires. Average BMI was 24.62 (weight ranged from 56 to 162 pounds). Data analysis revealed fruits and vegetables were consumed on average about 1-3 times a month. Reported fiber intake indicates low whole grain consumption. Additionally, fat consumption was 28% of total energy intake. Due to sample size, a correlation between chronic disease risk and dietary patterns was not identified. Additional research, including a larger sample size, to examine the associations and effects of specific dietary patterns of children living in Guam needs to be conducted. "

However, it is unclear how past relationships between people, fire, and climate played out on the landscape. The purpose of this research is to reconstruct the post-glacial paleoenvironmental history of a wetland known as Horsetail Lake, located in the Teanaway area of the eastern Cascades. The goal is to evaluate how fire activity and vegetation patterns have varied under different climatic scenarios during the last ~13,000 years and in relation to human land-use actions. This lake was selected because it is one of only a few natural wetlands that exist in the Teanaway area below an elevation of 4000 feet, and because the archaeological record supports the idea that people utilized mountain environments in the eastern Cascades similar to that around the site. In 2011, a 9 meter-long sediment core was extracted from Horsetail Lake using a modified Livingstone corer. High-resolution macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis is being used to reconstruct the fire and vegetation history of the Horsetail Lake watershed. The chronology of the sediment will be determined using radiocarbon (14C) dating and tephra layer identification. Preliminary results of this study show that fire frequency and severity has varied widely at Horsetail Lake during the post-glacial period. The early Holocene shows high fire activity with a drop in fire activity during the middle Holocene. Fire activity then becomes more frequent during the late Holocene. Completion of the pollen analysis will show how the forest around Horsetail Lake has changed both in terms of composition and structure in relation to the fire history. My results will hopefully be incorporated in future management plans of forest environments in the eastern Cascades as climate continues to change. "

However, in recent centuries, anthropogenic climate change and land-use actions (e.g., fire suppression) have severely disrupted pre-Euro-American settlement fire regimes, leading to the risk of catastrophic wildfires in many forests. Federal agencies are interested in using prescribed fire to restore historic forest mosaics and to reduce the risk of these conflagrations; however, there is a lack of fire history data from many areas in the PNW that spans more than a couple hundred years, including the Blue Mountains of Oregon. This study is reconstructing the fire history of the Fish Lake watershed in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest of the Blue Mountains using macroscopic charcoal analysis of a lake sediment core. The purpose of this research is to determine how fire regimes have changed at the site during the past ~12,000 years with respect to past climate variability. Fish Lake is located at an elevation 2,030 m and exists among trees with low fire return intervals, primarily lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Preliminary results indicate that infrequent high-severity fires have historically dominated the region. Our findings also suggest these fires have become more common in the last few hundred years. It is our hope that the information from this study can be used by forest managers to determine how fire activity may change in the future due to climate change."

A more thorough understanding of past fire frequency in the LLW will aid land owners and forest managers in planning for future fire events. In the summer of 2014 a nine meter-long sediment core was extracted from Long Lake, which is located approximately 5 km southeast of Rimrock Reservoir and 45 km west of Yakima. Fire event frequency was determined using macroscopic charcoal analysis, which quantifies the changing abundance of charcoal particles >125 ?m taken at contiguous 1-cm intervals throughout the core. Past fire severity is indicated by the ratio of woody to herbaceous charcoal, which was visually determined for each charcoal particle. Preliminary charcoal results show frequent fire episodes for approximately the last 9,000 years, with a noticeable decrease in fire occurrence in recent centuries. "

A cost surface analysis will be conducted using ARCmap GIS software to determine how many calories prehistoric hunter-gatherers expended traveling across the terrain over a given route.  The data derived from this study will be incorporated into an archaeological predictive model that predicts archaeological site locations based on the caloric costs of accessing an area and the caloric benefits of utilizing that area.  Since the model predicts the patterns of Native Americans, it will assume that travel is conducted on foot."

Despite the large amount of market and consumer attention placed specifically on diamonds since the war, there are other minerals mined in Africa that have become increasing categorized as conflict minerals. In the East Africa Rift Valley, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, a mineral rich region has been the location of many conflicts over the past 25 years. The question of whether minerals extracted in this region are being used by conflict actors to fund their rebellions has not been answered, yet little attention has been paid despite the possibility that minerals found in everyday life, including tin, copper, and could playing host to over 2 decades of bloodshed. This research will utilize ArcGIS and Statistix to analyze reports of attacks on civilian populations between 2010 and 2014 by conflict actors.  Incidents of violence against civilians will be further analyzed to spatially correlate attacks with mining locations to determine whether minerals being extracted from mines in the region can be classified as conflict minerals.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Eastern Washington Wildfires: Tracking Land Recovery in the Colockum Tarps Wildfire Area,Michael Balda,Geography,"Eastern Washington State has seen an increase in wildfire activity because of policies of fire suppression and changing climate. The Colockum Tarps wildfire started on July 27th, 2013 in Malaga, WA due to a water pump malfunction. After ignition, the fire quickly moved south-southwest and burned a total area of 80,408 acres of grasslands and forest. We combined fieldwork and geospatial analysis of aerial photography and satellite imagery to examine vegetative recovery within the fire area. Using ArcGIS and PCI Geomatica, we analyzed 2013 National Agricultural Imaging Program (NAIP) images and a wildfire perimeter shapefile from the Bureau of Land Management. We used Landsat 8 data from 2013, 2014 and 2015 provided by United States Geological Survey ? Earth Explorer. We also used aerial photos from 2013, and burn perimeter maps provided by the DNR to obtain pre- and post- fire vegetation conditions. We used DNR Inciweb reports to see daily weather conditions and to monitor fire growth. LANDSAT 8 imagery were processed for a change detection analysis and a Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) analysis.  We also conducted fieldwork at the site of the fire. Lastly, we analyzed the datasets to evaluate overall change and burn severity to identify recovery. Using air photo techniques, we found that climatic factors have the biggest impact on wildfire growth. Using remote sensing analysis, we found that there was a significant amount of regrowth of vegetation between the months of August and October 2013 in the grassland areas, but slow regrowth in forested areas."

Employing Landsat data and remote sensing techniques such as the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), this research examines snow cover change in Hatchers Pass, Alaska over a 28 year period. Results reveal that snow cover has dropped as much as 47% between 1986 and 2014 suggesting that, in addition to traditional cost benefit analysis, site specific environmental change studies should be considered when evaluating winter recreation investment."

However, fire activity in the region has generally been suppressed during the past approximately 100 years. As a result, forests in this region have recently begun to experience larger, more damaging fire events. One such event, the Carlton Complex Fire, burned during the summer of 2014. As the largest wildfire ever recorded in Washington state history, it burned more than 130,000 hectares, consumed 300 homes, and caused considerable infrastructure damage before it was contained.  In order to put recent fire activity in the eastern Cascades into perspective, long-term fire histories that span the past ~15,000 years are needed. Here we present results from a study at Green Lake, Washington, which sits approximately 42 km from the Carlton Complex Fire. The lake was cored during summer 2012 and a 4.43 m long sediment core was recovered, providing an approximately 7600 year-long record. High-resolution macroscopic charcoal analysis was used to reconstruct the fire history of the site, along with loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility analyses. Ratios of herbaceous to woody charcoal were used to determine fuel types and fire severity. Preliminary results indicate that low-severity ground fires were frequent throughout the record, but increased substantially after ca. 1400 AD and remained high until ca. 1850 AD. Future research will involve reconstructing the fire history of a lake within the Carlton Complex burn zone to compare with the Green Lake record."

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Wet-sites Artifacts: Preservation and Exhibition,Andrew Johnson,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Over the last sixty years archaeology has seen a rise in the discovery, excavation, and preservation of artifacts from ?wet? sites, which differ greatly in composition to that of artifacts recovered from more common ?dry? sites. Wet sites are unique as they are anaerobic. Oxygen is removed from the site through natural occurrences, this prevents bacteria and other agents of decay from taking hold on artifacts which would otherwise decay and vanish from the historical record. The result is a site rich in organic artifacts consisting of materials which are not found in other sites. Artifacts taken from wet sites pose difficulties and challenges that require a different tool set and conservation procedures in order to address the vulnerabilities of organic matter, which is as susceptible to decay. Artifacts taken from sites such as Hoko River and the Ozette Indian Village site, both in Washington State, as well as sites across the globe have shown the need for new techniques in how to deal with the various aspects with these artifacts. Because these artifacts have not been exposed to oxygen for such long periods of time, it is vital that while excavating, handling, preserving, etc. that the artifacts continue to be in an environment deprived of oxygen, otherwise decay will of these items will begin in earnest. In this poster I will explore the techniques and practices in achieving the needs of artifacts in a wet site."

For instance, are springs the location of diverse past human activities or do they represent a more limited activity location? The Bishop Hollow site (45KT1975) is located on the Yakima Training Center (YTC). Initial lithic analyses were performed on the material excavated at the site in the field and laboratory without the aid of magnification. An additional sample from this site was analyzed using magnification. The two samples are compared and the similarities and differences were used to assess the effects on the data that could be used to test hypotheses about past land use at springs. Results show that in the initial analysis there was 2% of objects identified with wear while in the subsequent analysis there was 5% identified with use wear. We have taken these results and explored the implications of such analytical biases imposed by doing lithic analysis with and without magnification. These results are relevant to those CRM (Cultural Resource Management) and research settings where analysts are considering whether they should use magnification in stone tool analysis.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Comparison of Radiometric Dating Techniques: Pacific Northwest,James Brown,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Radiometric dating is problematic in non-midden sites of the Pacific Northwest. Charcoal is ubiquitous in the forest soils and unburned bone readily dissolves. This fact impedes development of a regional chronologies and understanding of the process of resource intensification that was so important to development of Northwest cultures. To alleviate this deficiency, DirectAMS and Central Washington University undertook research to demonstrate the validity of alternatives to traditional radiocarbon dating of charcoal and bone, by using radiocarbon dating of calcined bone and luminescence dating. Calcined bone (bone burned in excess of 600øC) survives well in archaeological sites with acidic soils that are common to archaeological contexts along the Northwest Coast and has been found in the Old World to provide accurate radiocarbon dating. Luminescence dating can be applied to fire-cracked rock, which is common, particularly in food processing features. We developed a protocol for comparing calcined bone and luminescence dates with charcoal dates, taking all from the same features contexts. The comparison of the radiocarbon dating of charcoal and calcined bone to the luminescence dating of fire-cracked rock identifies the differences in the events that each medium dates and their association with the cultural activity associated with the cooking features. Results were compared for seven sites, demonstrating the validity of this approach to solving the region?s dating dilemma."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Comparative Morphological Analysis of Calcined Bone,David Davis,Anthropology & Museum Studies,"Along the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America, faunal remains are rarely preserved within archaeological contexts, outside of coastal sites with shell middens. This is primarily due to the degradation of bone by humic acids in the soils (pH 4.5-5.5) and carbonic acids caused by heavy precipitation. Preserved bones in archaeological contexts in this region are typically highly burned, or calcined.  Calcined bone is known to entail a size reduction compared to unburned bone, but the nature of the reduction is unknown. The question this project seeks to answer is: Does calcining cause significant change in bone size and weight? Consequently, this experiment documents the amount of change observed in artiodactyl phalanges (elk and black-tailed deer) by calcining, either via heating in a semi-temperature-controlled, outdoor wood fire, and/or by heating in a completely temperature-controlled, indoor muffle furnace. Twelve separate variables were measured before and after burning on the first phalanx and second phalanx specimens. Eight distinct variables were recorded on the third phalanx specimens. In addition to 38.13% mean weight loss expected due to the loss of the organic component of the bone, several variables exhibit noteworthy change. The ?height in region of extensor process? variable displays a mean reduction of 7.52%, and the ?breadth proximal? variable showed 4.39% mean reduction. Bones burned in the muffle furnace had uniform color and burning stage and no fracture, while those burned in the outside fire had variable results for all of these attributes, including extensive fracturing."

Experiments were conducted to establish the characteristics of cut marks on cattle bone left by a serrated steel knife, a straight-edged steel knife, an obsidian bifacial tool, a chert bifacial tool, an unmodified obsidian flake, and an unmodified chert flake. Comparative analysis of the slicing-marks showed the shape of slice marks created with the steel knives and obsidian flake were generally similar in width, depth and shape. Tool morphology played the largest role in dictating the shape of scrape marks, and tool edges defined by a pattern of bifacial flake scars or serration left clear signatures. Straight-edged tools left subtler characteristic scrape marks in the form of patches and striations suggesting the direction of the tool stroke. Tool marks left by steel knives, straight-edged and serrated, were the most prominent, uniform, and consistent. The shape of marks left by the bifacial tools were incredibly similar, meaning differentiation between material types is difficult and thus identification would likely only be able to be made to the level of bifacial stone tool."

For this study, statistical tests (Quadrat and Spearman Rank Correlation) were completed for the location of 116 housepit archaeological sites in relation to three rapids and three dams along a section of the Middle Columbia River, stretching approximately 60 miles from the Rock Island Dam at the north end to the beginning of the Hanford Reach at the south end. Housepit locations were tested against the location of rapids to test for correlation between favorable fishing locations and housepit locations. Housepit locations were also tested against the location of dams to test for correlation between a potential bias in the location of discovered archaeological sites, and housepit location. These tests found that housepit sites are significantly clustered, that their locations are correlated to the locations of rapids along this section of the Columbia River, and that their locations are not correlated to the locations of dam construction. These results are consistent with both previous data and the ethnographic record, supporting the location of housepit village sites near favorable fishing locations."

Here we present results of how various levels of pretreatment affect laser diffraction results. For this study, we subjected 35 sub-samples from seven different stratigraphic layers of the Sanders archaeological site (45KT315) in central Washington State to different combinations of pretreatment (removal of organic and inorganic carbon using 30% H2O2 and 1N HCl, respectively, and ultrasonic dispersion). Fully treated samples were presumed to be most accurate, and so were used as the test control. As expected, completely untreated samples exhibited excess coarse-sized particles (most negatively skewed). Other results demonstrate inter- and intra-sample variations that are likely due to differences in physical and chemical properties of each sample. No clear patterns emerge that lead us to conclude anything other than full pretreatment is required for best results.?"

This study focuses on interpreting how those challenges impact the degree of proximal facet concavity of the hallux in New World and Old World monkeys. The study uses measurements of halluces from 34 monkeys (Alouatta, Cebus, Lagothrix, Cercopithecus, Macaca, Miopithecus, and Papio) stored at the University of Oregon, and two (Macaca and Saimiri) at Central Washington University, using both traditional caliper methods and a MicroScribe three-dimensional digitizer. MicroScribe data includes nine landmarks, five on the proximal articular surface and four on the distal. Caliper measurements follow Marchi (2010). Monkey species comprise four locomotor groups from least to most arboreal. Regressions of MicroScribe data come from principal component scores via EVAN?s Toolbox (Phillips et al. 2010). Locomotion alone is significant, however size is a confounding variable. There is a significant correlation for locomotion and monkey size class combined (F(9, 28) =27.64, p<0.001, R2 =92.90, R2 Adjusted = 89.54). Size is the primary explanation for this variation, when looked at separately (F(7, 29)=26.40 p<0.001, R2=89.36, R2 Adjusted = 85.98). While the results show a difference between monkeys with extremely curved proximal articular surfaces and those with a flatter surface, it is difficult to correlate it to locomotion alone. The relationship between the relative flatness of the surface and allometry needs to be further explored."

The thicker the hydration layer, the longer since the tool was made. OHA can be used to test hypotheses about changes through time in past trade and exchange systems at the Grissom site (45KT301) in Kittitas County. A sample of the sourced obsidian (n=35) from the Grissom site was analyzed and sent off for OHA measurements. The results show that the range of hydration rim thickness are consistent with human occupation over the last 3,000 years. There was no visible correlation between the artifact type and the hydration rim thickness. Of the seven sources of obsidian artifacts that were analyzed, two sources have hydration rim thicknesses only greater than 2 microns. There were four sources with hydration rim thicknesses only less than 2 microns.  A single source had hydration rim thicknesses both greater and less than 2 microns. If we assume that hydration rim thickness is at least in part a function of time, obsidian source diversity increased through time.  These results may show that only one source was being used consistently through time at the Grissom site, while two sources were abandoned, and four new sources were utilized instead. The geographical distances from the Grissom site to the sources also increases over time, showing expansion of resource utilization, a result in contrast to conclusions made in other studies on changing obsidian source diversity.

Bone and teeth samples from five sites on Barbados and one on Barbuda were processed by the Center for Applied Isotopic Studies, University of Georgia, and data are reported for ë13Cco, ë13Cca, ë15Nco, and ë18Oap. Stable isotope ratios, adjusted ratios, and apatite-collagen spacing correspond with results from elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles. After adjustment, all of the ë15N bone and teeth samples are within the food web range for marine protein resources. Adjusted values for samples from Heywoods, Chancery Lane, Goddard, and Light & Power sites are indicative of a marine diet.

As the years march onward, conditions in Palestine continue to degrade. Palestinians face many problems with respect to humanitarian and developmental aid. Conditions are harsh, both because of the extreme weather and continued conflict with the Israeli military and diplomatic policies. Lack of communication and travel abilities between Gaza and the West Bank, and even between neighboring villages in each region, continue to lead to wider disparity between the two geographic regions creating dramatically different levels of need depending upon location. The policy proposed by this project includes a scale developed to provide flexibility in assessing the needs of communities on a case by case basis. This project focuses on the current issues faced in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in regards to education, food, and water security, as well as a proposed plan of action that involves the assistance of the UN and partner NGOs that are already active in the region. The scale developed herein is targeted specifically at these issues in this region, however it can easily be broadened to address needs in other categories of aid as well as in other states in need of aid as the global political and geological climate alters over time. The overarching goal of the scale is to provide a ground for assessment that can lead each region through the stages of humanitarian aid, to developmental aid, and onward to stability."

As the industrial base expanded the need for vocational education to keep up with the escalating demand for technical expertise and skills became increasingly important in China. Liuzhou city, as one of western China?s most important industrial cities is an example of this kind of rapid growth and of the way in which continued development now depends on vocational education. To meet the demands of the growing industrial base Liuzhou City government has established new colleges and upgraded existing city facilities. The analysis on which the poster is based examines the case of the Liuzhou Vocational & Technical College (LVTC). Recognized as one of the best vocational colleges in China, LVTC successfully meets the critical demands of both modernization and growth. The poster deals with the following important components of success: (1) Goals consistent with the local economic and social development goals and needs, (2) majors that match up with the local Labor market demand, (3) university-enterprise cooperation education projects, (4) support of social services, (5) preparation of students for the global economy, and (6) leadership in regional vocational education reform and development."

As the industrial economy of Liuzhou City expanded the port was increasingly unable to keep up with the import and export demands of the Liuzhou foreign trade market. The upgrading of the Port of Liuzhou has become a key factor in supporting the city?s economy and sustaining its growth. This task falls to the Liuzhou Port Administration Office. As is the case everywhere expansion requires both authorization and the adequate appropriation of funds. Since the port is located in the West River Economic Zone, its recent upgrading at the National Development and Strategic Level will greatly facilitate Liuzhou?s efforts to establish a comprehensive bonded zone. The Port of Liuzhou as an inland port faces a unique set of problems that requires the integration of three key components: the inland river port, the dry port and the airport.

It is the second largest city and the largest industrial base in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Over the past twenty years, the processes of industrialization and urbanization have resulted in pollution and a shortage of the land that pose barriers to further development. To cope with these problems Liuzhou city has devised a strategy for the transformation for the city?s economic development known as the ?Revitalization of the Urban Core? plan. Transformation involves extending the urban core through the creation of new districts, conversion of rural to urban space, and development of peripheral industrial parks. Once new space is available old polluting industries can construct and move to new less polluting facilities and the space they vacate can be revitalized: cleaned up and used to develop high end technology and service sectors in the old core. As one of the urban areas of Liuzhou city, Yufeng district is a primary target for transformation. This analysis deals with the problems and the revitalization measures used to address them, the progress and current status of these efforts, and the challenges of the revitalization that remain for Yufeng district and Liuzhou city."

The project explains and the poster depicts how the city was restored and is now once again recognized for ?the most beautiful landscape in an industrial city and the strongest industrial city with a beautiful landscape? in China. The transition from polluted industrial center to ecologically balanced, livable industrial city was accomplished through the implementation of comprehensive plans for economic upgrading and urban transformation. Focusing on the physical environment the poster shows both the dynamics of degradation in the last decades of the 20th Century and the policies that have brought about recovery and restoration since 2000.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Sustainable Local Agriculture to Support Liuzhou's Metropolitan Complex,Xiaojie Huang,Political Science,"In China a majority of the population is involved in the large agricultural economy. Since rural incomes lag well behind those of urban areas, improving farm income is a major concern. The rising demand for meat caused by the development of the urban economy and society makes development of a breeding industry a mutually beneficial way to do it. Liuzhou city has a rural population of 1,596,800, accounting for 41.75% of the total resident population. The municipal government is focused on the efforts to develop the whole city's breeding industry, but it could not be done using traditional methods. Small backyard breeding operators posed a serious constraint to the development of breeding industry because of the large fluctuations they created in meat prices. These economic conditions were not conducive to expansion of the scale of breeding, but only such an expansion could solve the problem. Through a series of policies that provide financial support and loans through banks to the breeding enterprises at a discounted rate the Liuzhou City government is mitigating the market problem and eliminating it over time as livestock production transitions from the traditional backyard model to standardized and large-scale breeding.  After six years, the large scale-breeding rate has reached over 50% and the value of livestock production accounts for 30.88% of total value of agricultural output. The per capita net income of farmers has shown an annual growth rate of 14.53% reaching $191.93 dollars at present. "

An adequate supply of quality housing for all citizens is   the most essential factor in livability. This is especially true in China where home ownership has been a prerequisite for happiness since ancient times. Because basic housing, as a ?necessity of life?, is now guaranteed by the state, the government must supervise and adjust the housing market. At the same time, experience has shown that adequate housing for different income categories cannot be provided by the government alone. This analysis examines the policies and strategies adopted by Liuzhou over the past 10 years to maintain the city?s livability in the face the population explosion caused by the urbanization. For instance, the municipal government has been implementing urban redevelopment and construction of new district to ensure the supply of construction land.

SSA Marine, a major shipping company, proposed the construction of a shipping terminal off the coast of Bellingham Washington to greatly reduce the time it would take to transport coal from the central United States to Asia. As a consequence, the amount of rail line traffic would increase. An additional 18 trains a day, up from the usual 7, would pass through the city that would cut off businesses major intersections. Some roads accessing the waterfront would be closed for up to two hours. This has raised concerns over the potential negative economic impacts of trains blocking businesses multiple times a day times a day, and access to the waterfront in the event of an emergency. There is also the environmental impacts of having thousands of open air coal train cars passing through the coastal city every day. This policy analysis covers all the effects of the proposal using similar examples of other coal rail lines and how they affect the surrounding communities and environment. "
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Production, Taxation and Sale of Legalized Marijuana ",Curtis Reid,Political Science,"In this modern era we are faced with a dilemma. Due to outdated and archaic legislation and policy, money that is being generated by legal marijuana producers in Oregon, Colorado, and Washington cannot legally enter the fiscal stream. This is due to states legalizing the production and sale of marijuana, but federal legislation prohibits banking institutions from accepting this legalized cash flow. In addition to this, the criminal status of Marijuana and the ensuing tax code law creates several massive negative externalities at the local, state, and federal level. There is a massive disconnect between what the federal government is saying, what the state governments are doing, and a power struggle happening between the federal and state government agencies. This needs to be resolved in a timely and efficient manner to resolve the externalities and begin proper taxation and efficient revenue collection at all levels. "
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Patenting Genes: GMOs,Kelsey Gibbs,Political Science,"Protecting intellectual integrity of inventions is not a new concept. Protection in the form of patents dates as early as Ancient Greece. In the U.S, patent laws have a very broad scope that has been very loosely interpreted. These laws were designed to protect man made innovations. Until the 1980's this principle has been upheld. In 1980 a supreme court case ruled that a bacteria had been genetically modified by the insertion of genes. The inserted genes transformed the bacteria from a product of nature to a commodity. This case opened a flood-gate of patents sought after for genetically modified organisms. A patent is a mutually beneficial agreement between inventors and society. In exchange for full disclosure about a product, the inventor is granted a limited monopoly on a product. The shift  that occurred in 1980 allowing a patent on genes started a monopoly over plants and crops. Allowing patents on living organisms is causing a monopoly over certain crops. This monopoly is causing too many farmers to lose their livelihood due to patent infringement. The ethical debate regarding GMOs is constant; however, the real concern should be the ability to patent these genes. Allowing the patenting of genes is a slippery slope that has potential to devastate the food supply and subject farmers to a lifetime of debt and lawsuits. The purpose of this presentation is to analyze current patent laws with regards to genetically modified organisms and propose alternatives to protect farmers from unintentional patent infringement."
Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,"Analysis of the ""use it or lose it"" policy",Taylor Wilkinson,Political Science,"The ?use it or lose it? policy was designed to encourage continual beneficial use of water. Since water is considered a public resource, a water right can be revoked whenever a user fails to meet the beneficial use test. Water is a scarce resource in the eastern part of Washington State and if it is not being used beneficially or if only a portion of the water allotted in the right is used, it theoretically would be allotted to another user who would utilize the water more efficiently. This ?use it or lose it? policy has had negative effects, both economically and ecologically. To avoid relinquishing water rights, holders will often waste water by using it in ways that are not ?beneficial"" in efforts to protect their allocations. Fortunately this problem can be mitigated by adopting market based solutions such as water markets, which would change the basis from ?beneficial use? to ?willingness to pay?. Policy alternatives examined will include (1) redefining of ?beneficial use?, (2) altering the time associated with the relinquishment statue, and (3) restructuring of water right allocation from prior appropriation to willingness-to-pay.

Mar. 13th 11:30-2:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Vietnamese Migration Patterns and Public Policy,Johnny  Nguyen,Political Science,"At the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, South Vietnam natives sought to escape Vietnam from the communist reign of its North counterpart. Fueled by the former Communist revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh?s, dream of uniting Vietnam under one communist ideal, the north cemented their occupation in the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the retreat of all American Soldiers. Along with the retreat of thousands of American troops, came the many waves of Vietnamese immigrants to steadily make their way to various parts of the world including the US, Canada, Australia, and France. The research will also explore how migration patterns of South Vietnamese has effected public policy in the western hemisphere. The influx of South Vietnamese on US soil pushed policy makers in Washington D.C. to create programs like the Orderly Departure Program, which moved over 500,000 South Vietnamese to the US. The influx also led to a great number of amendments to the famous Immigration Act (Hart-Celler Act) which continually raised the amount of visas administered to immigrants from all over eastern countries. This paved to way for not only Vietnamese immigrants but many from Indochina. Lastly, we will look at the result of these migration patterns and how it has affected the new generation of Vietnamese citizens in the US. We will examine the densest populations of Vietnamese-Americans in states and explore their various demographics across education, socioeconomic income, political philosophies, etc.

It is projected to increase by 1 billion over the next 12 years. There is only 5% of usable farming land left on earth. Food is a resource that humans must consume daily. These facts undeniably lead to a shortage of food in the future. It is essential to mankind survival that farming becomes more efficient and sustainable. This provided the motivation to design a more efficient transmission for the Victair Mistifier (orchard and vineyard sprayer). Victair Mistifiers are designed, engineered, and manufactured by H.F. Hauff Company in Yakima, WA. The Hauff Company?s commitment to manufacturing the best sprayer on the market accompanied with the desire to address sustainable farming, are the driving forces behind this project. The scope of the project is to design, develop, and test a gearbox that optimizes the overall function of the sprayer. The gearbox simplifies the overall design of the sprayer, by replacing 19 major components with 8. This design decreases material costs, increases manufacturability, and decreases assembly time. The gearbox receives power from the tractor?s power take-off (PTO) via the input shaft. It transmits the power through machine elements to two shafts that will power fans. The fans will spin in opposite directions at an equal, desired rotational speed. The transmission will be enclosed in an engineered metal casted housing. The gearbox design was proven, by the prototype, to perform to specifications while maintaining an oil temperature of less than 90 degrees Celsius."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Dump Bed Lifting Mechanism,Zachary Pate,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","The project was motivated by a need to create a device that would cause a small truck or trailer bed to lift up quickly and dump its contents. This would eliminate the need to use manual physical labor, which is both slow and exhausting. Additional design constraints require the stroke and diameter of the cylinder to be 6? x2?.  A design was conceived with the intent to incorporate a less costly device onto an existing trailer frame that would lift the bed and dump the load. With this in mind, a scissor lift device would have two basic requirements, first to lift 500 pounds and second to achieve a 40 degree angle of lift. The intended design is called a scissor lift. Lifting mechanisms for dump trucks are too large and expensive for use on a small six foot trailer. Designing a lift to use a smaller cylinder to accomplish the same task as a larger lift, was accomplished with engineering design. This smaller cylinder presents a geometric challenge so there is enough lift to tilt and dump the load. To accomplish this, the lift will have to accommodate the cylinder to transfer its force through the arms. The calculations predicted that a .5 gpm hydraulic pump would take 62 seconds to lift 500 pounds, dump and lower the load. Initial tests indicated a tilt goes to 39 degrees. "

This device will be called a Wakeboard Winch and will need to meet specific design requirements to ensure adequate performance.  For the winch design to be considered effective it must be able to support up to a 200-pound wakeboard rider, be able to achieve a maximum tow speed of 25 mph, and the final winch assembly should weigh less than 200-pounds. Rationale: The design and manufacturing of the winch must be optimized to meet the design requirements established, while also minimizing the cost of production. Methods: The Wakeboard Winch will be designed using mechanical engineering methods relating to power transmissions using shafts, torque converters, and roller chain drives. Along with this, the winch will be fabricated using manufacturing processes learned throughout the MET coursework which may include but is not limited to ? milling, machining, and welding. Results: At this time, the Wakeboard Winch has been mocked-up and preliminary testing has been completed to ensure successful operation. Final assembly will be completed the second week of April and testing is scheduled to follow shortly after. Principal Conclusions: The preliminary evaluation of the winch displayed adequate operation giving promise to meeting the 200-pound weight limit and 25mph speed limit established by the design requirements."

This project incorporated a machined production component from a local manufacturer and designed and produced an equivalent component using the casting process.  The casting material chosen needed to be able to withstand all tension and compression forces when the component is used in service along with locations and dimensions of holes needed to be in accordance with all specified tolerances.  The casting design process had to account for draft issues, shrinkage during material solidification, porosity and internal cavities formed during solidification, and overall optimization of material used for the casting process.  The use of computer simulated solidification software aided in the design of runner and gating dimensions as well as predetermining significant problem areas for porosity and internal cavities within the castings. The manufacture of the mold pattern and core boxes was completed using the additive manufacturing process of three dimensional printing.  Using this process eliminates the use of any machining processes for the manufacture of the casting along with significantly reducing the amount of man hours for fabrication.  The patterns were made as well as the castings poured at Central Washington University using the 3-D printers and the foundry located in the engineering building.  Success of this project will be determined through comparison of all dimensions to the current machined components and performance testing when put into service."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Pivoting Foot Pegs,Michael LeBlanc,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","The ability to keep a dirt bike rider?s feet in full contact with the foot pegs at all times is something all riders? face when riding their bike. The foot pegs that come factory and aftermarket today are universally static and non-rotational which prevent the ability for maximum contact to be maintained. During various riding positions, a rider?s foot can partially become disconnected from the peg allowing for a loss of potential control and balance/stability. The solution devised was a set of pegs that have the ability to rotate with the rider?s foot. The rotational ability of the pegs allow for the rider?s feet to stay in full contact throughout various riding positions or conditions. The pivoting peg allows for full contact with the pegs provides more stability and control over the bike which improves capabilities of balance and speed/momentum. To accomplish the pivoting, a round shaft with limiting stops was created to rotate fifteen degrees forward and backwards on the bike. Based on the design concept that was created and calculations that were done on the design, such as deflection and load bearing calculations, these pegs will easily any issues support the weight of a 185 pound rider, while still having the capability to rotate without binding. More testing of these pegs is scheduled for spring quarter 2015. From the calculations that were prepared, the pegs will pivot fifteen degrees and support the minimum weight requirement of 185 pounds.  "

This project covers the design and manufacturing of components for a radio controlled car to race in the annual ASME RC Baja competition. For this project the car was broken down into its component subsystems and divided between two partners. It was then determined which components of each respective subsystem could be purchased and which required design and manufacture within the rules set forth in the ASME Baja competition rule book. All of the parts, both to be purchased and to be manufactured, were first drawn in SolidWorks to check alignment and for ease of FE analysis before manufacturing began. Parts and systems that were designed include: chassis of the car, differential and gear train, steering system, and the suspension system. Diverse manufacturing methods were used including waterjet cutting, 3d-printing, and the use of manual mills and lathes which in the future will be converted to CNC operations for ease of manufacturing. Both hands on and computer testing thus far has shown that the car will be successful in completing the tasks that are required of it at the RC Baja competition. To conclude, after the design and manufacturing of this car was completed a functional vehicle that starts, stops, and turns without issue was successfully created and functional testing will be completed at the competition."

The replaceable friction surfaces provide a means to mitigate cost to the end user. The structure is constrained by the dimensions, 11.75? diameter and 1.25? width and serves as a direct replacement rotor for a circle track racecar. Analyses provide a direct comparison in static mass, moments of inertia, and forced convection thermal calculations in order to determine if the concept was viable. Requirements for a successful design were a 22% reduction in total rotating mass, resist a linear deceleration rate of 8 meters per second, and the centripetal forces of an angular velocity of 315 radians per second. Off-car testing revealed a 4 pound reduction in static rotor mass and achieved a 34% reduction in the moment of inertia. On-car testing involved data logging multiple laps at a local racetrack and displayed a higher theoretical peak temperature than the conventional design. The composite structure the heat was rejected earlier in the cool down phase of the lap resulting in higher steady state of absorption/radiation characteristics. Means of monitoring the performance are by way of a GPS accelerometer and remote mounted infrared guns mounted to each hub.

The drive of this project was to develop a branch cutting mechanism which would provide a senior citizen or an individual with limited upper body strength, with the ability to cut through branches that would otherwise pose challenging. The design would allow the end user to cut a branch by simply pulling a trigger. A branch cutting attachment was designed to attach to the front of a DeWALT cordless impact gun. This attachment will convert the rotational torque and motion from the impact gun into a shearing motion which can be utilized by a set of cutting blades to cut through the branches. This conversion came through a worm gear set that simultaneously changes the rotational direction of motion and increases the output torque of the impact gun through the gear set. The cutter was constructed from lightweight aluminum to keep the weight down as it is a hand held tool and was also designed to be easily attached and detached from the impact gun for ease of use. The design incorporated off the shelf blades so that in the event a blade was damaged during use a new blade was easy to obtain. Through testing it was found that the cutting attachment performed well on a variety of tree branch types and sizes up to 1-1/8?. It was also found that the attachment was easy to use by all user types."

With approximately 150 million Americans that use corrective eye-ware on a daily basis, the need for improved technology in glasses cases is inevitable. Current glasses cases work to either protect the glasses and are big and bulky, or are made smaller to be more easily transported. The concept is to take any pair of glasses and make a custom case for them. The programs being utilized to complete the project are solidworks and excel.  The process is started by making a base layout of the glasses case in solidworks. Then a excel spreadsheet was made. Linking an excel spreadsheet to solidworks enables rapid input of new dimension to adjust solidworks drawing to the correct or new size. This provides a quick way to make my case fit any pair of glasses, no matter the dimensions. The solidworks model is then saved as a Stereolithography file and sent to the 3-d printer. The cases came out fully functional and open and close perfectly.  From sit down to completed glasses case depends on the size of the glasses the case was modeled around. The more cubic inches the case is, the longer it takes to print. The  first case took 10 hours to print."

Cell phones, moreover, allow people to share photos online immediately, so many people prefer to take photos or videos by cell phones instead with expensive cameras. Thus, the purpose of this project is to design and build a light weight quadcopter frame and select the system components that allow the quadcopter to fly smoothly while carrying a cell phone for aerial video. The method for creating the quadcopter is separated into three steps: design, build, and test. The design part includes frame design on the SolidWorks and Thrust/Weight ratio calculation with a safety factor of 1.0 to 1.5.  The build consists of a center plate made of carbon fiber plate, and aluminum sheet metal arms are formed into a U-shape and attached to the plate. The drill press, treadle shear, and manual turret punch are used during the building process. The remaining parts, such as cellphone carrier, battery, motors, speed controller, and control board among others were purchased after the analysis.

The heat exchanger used in the brewing program here at CWU is a brazed plate and frame heat exchanger, so it cannot be taken apart for cleaning. Due to this, the overall efficiency of the heat exchanger will be reduced, causing fouling, because of the buildup of brewing material. In order to effectively combat this fouling, a heat exchanger must be constructed that can be disassembled for cleaning, and then reassembled with ease, while still being able to perform the same amount of heat transfer as the brazed system. Specifically, a gasketed plate and frame heat exchanger was constructed for this purpose, which utilizes rubber gaskets to seal the system, instead of brazing. This heat exchanger was constructed using twenty stainless steel plates, with four flow holes punched for the fluid paths, and arranged with the attached gaskets in a cross flow pattern. To test the effectiveness of this system, the heat exchanger will operate using cold tap water to cool down water heated to approximately 200 øF. The output temperature of the water will be measured, in order to see how well the heat exchanger is able to transfer heat between the two fluids. The results of this test will indicate the viability of this system, state the specific rate of heat transfer within this system, and compare this value to the previously utilized brazed heat exchanger.

The objective of this design was to provide the consumer with a lightweight and simplistic suspension system that would meet the performance demands of the consumer market. In order to meet the strength to weight ratio requirements of this design, composites were implemented to provide the necessary structural strength for the overall system. A one piece carbon fiber sub frame is the first of its kind and provides a foundation for all other components to fasten too. By replacing structural materials that were initially made from a high strength steel with a light weight carbon fiber, the weight savings are substantial and can be observed throughout the system. In order to determine the success of this design, a series of tests both on and off the vehicle were performed to accurately describe the behavior of the material under load. 3 point bending, load analysis, and weight comparison are examples of the test processes that will provide conclusive data on the overall performance of this design.

Riding a dirt bike in snow has been recently explored by only a few companies the past few years. Why not design our own working system? A Honda Cr250r dirt bike became the test model and a front mount for a snow ski was designed. This ski would replace the front wheel/tire, while a paddle tire would be implemented at the rear of the bike. After all thirteen parts are machined from the CNC, table mill, band saw, and surface grinders, the device is considered complete and will be properly mounted to the dirt bike. When tested, the dirt bike should handle well in the snow by making tight turns, long sweeping turns, and tracking straight with ease.

Asphalt emulsion is sprayed onto the surface to act as a sacrificial barrier. To pump this asphalt emulsion for spray application an effective pressure relief device must be incorporated. High pressure is needed to achieve the desired spray pattern, but this same pressure can cause components to fail in the presence of a pressure spike. Hydraulically driven positive displacement pumps are used to pump the emulsion, so a pinched hoses or a clog in the system results in a severe pressure spike. Due to the emulsions viscosity and abrasive additives a direct relief device is not suitable for long term service. A remote activated pressure relief device is needed to allow adequate spray pressure and prevent system failure. The device is manufactured with off the shelf hydraulic and pneumatic parts bolted to a steel base plate. A pilot pressure is taken from the emulsion circuit and feeds a pneumatic cylinder that pulls a linearly actuated hydraulic valve, in turn diverting the hydraulic flow to the reservoir instead of driving the pump. The pull of the cylinder is balanced by an adjustable spring to allow for different pressure settings. After installing the pressure relief device pressure was be measured at different locations throughout the system. The emulsion pressure relief device performed an as engineered and the pressure remained between 50 and 90 psi. "

The electric vehicle that the Central Washington University Electric Vehicle Club is building needs a front suspension. The vehicle is being built  to compete in the Electrathon America Race in May of 2015. The suspension attaches to the wheels and attaches to the frame of the vehicle and provides bump dampening. The suspension was built was using a single swing arm type design. This design consists of six parts that are welded and bolted together to connect the wheel to the frame. The shock absorber that is attached to the single swing arm that absorbs the shock of the vehicle's weight as it goes over irregularities in the road. The design of the suspension had to fit within the constraints of the preexisting frame. The suspension was manufactured using the tools in the Central Washington University Machine Shop and Power Lab for under $140. The suspension weighs 9.6lbs per side and is made of steel. Initial tests  so far have shown that it is strong enough to hold the static load of the vehicle plus the driver.  The suspension provides the wheels with the 50ft turning diameter requirements. The shock travel requirement will need some modifications before it meets the desired specification. The suspension is operational and is ready to undergo testing and eventually be ready to compete in the Electrathon America Race.

Bicycles are bulky and difficult to store. A device is needed to store two road bikes weighing up to 40 pounds each while saving as much space as possible. To solve this problem many iterations of various free standing and wall-leaning bike rack designs were drawn. Evolution of the design can be traced through the drawings included in the report. The first design analyzed was a free standing rack. After calculations and adjustments this design was going to have to be very bulky in order to achieve the stability requirements. The next design that was analyzed was a wall-leaning rack. This design was very compact and satisfied the stability requirements gracefully. In winter, materials were ordered and prepared for construction. Construction included cutting ABS pipe, gluing or drilling and pinning fittings. Construction was completed without major issues. The final device is working properly despite a couple of minor clearance related oversights. The bike rack supports two bikes weighing 35 pounds each. The compactness requirement of 72 inches squared was met. This spring the deflection of the rack will be tested and compared to the predicted data.  The racks capacity to support loads up to 40 pounds will be tested. A test will be run where the rack is loaded with two bikes and the floor area and volume occupied can be found.

The purpose of this project for an individual to grow several plants with limited involvement. The greenhouse has temperature sensors, humidity sensors, fans, lighting, and a water reservoir. It is controlled and regulated using the sensors to alert a program in Lab View on when to operate fans or lighting to regulate the heat. The water reservoir also has a sensor to alert the owner when the water level is low and needs to be filled. This is the only physical work that will need to be done by the owner. Besides filling the reservoir the greenhouse can be set for a certain temperature for desired plant growth and simply left alone for days while the plant is completely taken care of."

The temperature is constantly monitored and controlled through a temperature/humidity sensor that will turn fans on/off when the temperature rises too high. Temperature, humidity, soil moisture and water level are all displayed on a monitor for convenience. Since the greenhouse is an indoor greenhouse, the monitored values should remain consistent; however alarms will sound should control limits be triggered. Control levels can be easily changed for different plant needs. Water-level must be restored manually when the level drops below a user-defined set point."

By simply applying a motor to the front wheel of a bicycle, attached to a battery pack and a throttle it is possible to convert a plain bicycle into a primitive electric motorcycle. While a plain bicycle is already green and environmentally friendly, some of us need that extra help in getting to our destination faster and easier. While the motor is attached to the front wheel, and the pedals are already attached to the back wheel conversion between the two are simple and easy to allow versatility for the user. Thorough testing will be needed to determine how long a fully charged battery can be used before recharging is necessary as well as distance. While wide distribution of pre-made kits are available, building and testing these kits will help determine the actual practicality of using a kit and the potential of becoming useful and simplistic enough to be used by the average American."

Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Solar Evaporative Air Handler,Sam Budnick,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","The purpose of any engineering project is to anticipate a need and meet that need through prediction analysis and design.  Over 70% of the nation?s energy is consumed by building infrastructure such as HVAC systems, electrical, etc.  HVAC systems use boilers to generate hot water or steam to heat buildings and evaporative chillers to provide air conditioning, much like the central plant here on campus.  The project included the construction of a solar collector that will heat water to 140F in order to run it through a heat exchanger that can have air passed over it.  An evaporative chiller was also designed to harness the latent heat of vaporization to chill a heat exchanger that can then have water passed through it.  The circulation pump and any temperature sensors will be powered by a photovoltaic array so that no electricity is needed to power the device.  The air from the ducted fan can then be passed over this heat exchanger in order to generate hot air for a room, and the same for the cold air with cold water.  Testing will consider input and output water temperature, as well as input and output air temperature in order to compare the changes and develop a value for efficiency.  Initial testing has found that 140F heating water can provide enough load in a heat exchanger to provide 85F leaving air temperature.  Water that has been cooled to 40F by the evaporative chiller can provide a leaving air temperature of 55F."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Collapsible Bicycle Frame,Keith Stone,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","Traveling with a full size bicycle can be problematic. A light weight bicycle frame was designed to collapse to be able to fit into carry-on luggage for transport on an airplane. The required dimensions of the suitcase are 22 by 14 by 9 inches. This bicycle was also designed to be able to sustain a load of 200 pounds, with minimal deflection throughout the frame. The frame was constructed using aluminum 6061-T6 tubes that were cut to specific size to be used for telescoping tubes along the front triangle of the frame, known as the top, down and seat tubes. The telescoping tubes are pin locked when extended to ensure the structural integrity of the frame. These hitch pins were selected due to the ball bearing at the end of the pin, which helps keep the pin in place while the bicycle is being used. The frame along the chain and seat stays of the frame use pin locking tube hinges. These hinges were specifically chosen for this project so that they could assist in easily collapsing the bicycle, while keeping the structural integrity of the bike intact. The designed frame was not to exceed 15 pounds and the finished product was successful, weighing in at less than 13 pounds. While the dimensions of the frame are 38 by 22 by 6 inches when fully extended, the final dimensions of the frame when it is collapsed are 22 by 14 by 5 inches. Other results include load and deflection testing."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Collapsible Wheelchair Wheel,Joseph Fischer,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","Portability, convenience, and efficiency are becoming more and more prevalent as technology increases. This is also true with wheelchairs; Wheelchairs are being designed to fold and collapse smaller and smaller with every iteration but there is one parameter that remains constant, the wheel. No matter how small the wheelchair frame folds it is always limited by its? wheel?s diameter. This project aims to create a collapsible wheel design to accompany a foldable wheelchair in order to make it more portable and storable. Since the diameter of the wheel is the limiting factor in a foldable wheelchair, the relatively small width dimension of the wheel was increased in order to compensate for the reduction of the diameter dimension. This was achieved by creating a wheel composed of six equal parts that interlock to form a solid, functional wheel capable of supporting a human to the weight capacity of other wheelchairs (250 pounds). It is also important that the wheel is easy and quick to assemble and disassemble for users of all ages and capability. It will be tested for strength but also for how quickly it can be assembled and disassembled. To achieve a 1-minute assembly time, quick release hinges were used, an instruction manual was created, and magnet and Velcro attach points were implemented. This collapsible wheel design collapses a standard 24-inch wheelchair wheel to an 11.25 by 10.75 by 6.00-inch assembly. This is a reduction of 83% of its original frontal area when collapsed. "
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Improved Drop-Weight Tennis Racquet Stringer,William Ligon-Bruno,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","What design change to a conventional ATS Sports model drop-weight stringer can be made to decrease the stringing time for a tennis racquet? To answer this, a detailed analysis on design, manufacturability, and structural integrity was done to design a product that is manufacturable within the timeframe and produces a device which decreases the stringing time. First, an analysis on each vital component was done including the ratcheting components, pressure arm/drop mass, etc. Second, a virtual model was created with auxiliary components to test different designs. Through this analysis and the virtual model it was indicated that a duel stringing device opposed to a conventional single stringing device would meet the design requirements set forth in the project report. A more detailed design was done to the device to finalize the product for manufacturing. This included reducing the weight of the product through shelling out components and using lightweight material, reducing the cost through utilizing cheaper pre-designed material other than requesting custom designed material, modifying dimensions for the correct weight distribution, and planning for the ergonomics of use. The manufacturing process consisted of machining and 3D printing over 40 parts. After final assembly, modifications are again assessed to increase functionality. Testing results should demonstrate a reduction in the time needed to string a racquet by half and produce a tension from 30-90lbs as stated in the design requirements."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Toyota Disk Brake Conversion,Geoffrey  Gibson,"Engineering Technologies, Safety, & Construction","A common issue with Toyota pickups from the 1980?s is the factory braking system is not responsive enough for the driver to properly brake during an emergency situation. The cause of the poor response in braking comes from the drum brakes that are on the rear of the vehicle. Aftermarket vendors offered disk brake conversions that change the brakes on the rear axle from drum to disk. The aftermarket brackets that are in the conversion are thick and bulky adding excess weight to the already heavy pickup. These thick brackets in the conversion do not retain the factory emergency brake which is required to maintain proper functionality. To remedy the issue, a set of brackets were designed around the use of Ford Mustang calipers and Mitsubishi Montero rotors in order to retain the factory emergency brake and to maintain the correct wheel lug pattern. In order to reduce the bulk of the brackets, stress analysis was performed on the bracket design to find the minimum allowable thickness. This was performed over multiple materials to use different thicknesses. Once a thickness was calculated for each material, it was reevaluated to ensure that the brackets would not deflect more than what the tolerance allowed. With brackets designed and built, they will be tested on the test vehicle where the deflection of the bracket will be recorded and compared to the .005? tolerance. The calculations that were performed prove the vehicle will safely stop in the specified distance of 75ft. from 40 mph."

The gripping assemblies would enable tensile, or pulling force, tests on tensile specimens up to 20,000 lbs, being able to test high carbon steel. The gripping assemblies and mounting adapters were designed and manufactured completely by a Central Washington University Mechanical Engineering Technology student who used the cumulative knowledge gained from engineering analysis and manufacturing courses over the span of his four years at Central. All design and manufacturing were done using the Central Washington University facilities and laboratories with the exception of heat treatments which were outsourced. It is estimated that the initial device construction will cost $771.00 and 440 man hours. Most gripping assemblies in industry cost anywhere between $6,000 and $15,000 for assemblies with a 20,000 lb load capacity. The design of the gripping assemblies is simple with no luxury of hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical clamping capabilities. The manufacture of the initial pair of gripping assemblies was unreasonable and robust due to limitations governed by the capabilities of Central Washington University?s lab facilities which also added unreasonable hours to the amount of man hours required. In common industrial factories/warehouses owned by testing machine manufacturers, the amount of man hours would be significantly less"

This project tests the effects of hands-on vs computer simulated learning on content retention and critical thinking. We predicted that students would have higher content retention and critical thinking as a result of the hands-on lessons. We lead students through of two learning segments. The first segment, half of the class studied circuits through a simulation, and half studied circuits through hands-on interaction. The second segment, students switch to the opposite lesson style. In between each of these segments, students received an assessment to test their content retention and critical thinking gains. The lesson plan used was a 5E lesson plan model, where students are lead through an inquiry process to explore concepts. During the first learning segment, students receiving the hands on mode of instruction received higher scores than the PHET simulation by 15%. During the second learning segment, students receiving the hands on mode of instruction saw a 3% increases compared to the PHET simulation group. While the results showed increased scores in hands on instruction, the margins were not large enough to be a significant factor in test scores. Further refining and exploration of the effectiveness of online simulations in particular the effectiveness of the teacher delivering the mode of instruction to determine the effectiveness of new age technology.

Choice of a Mathematics Based Career,Veronica Guadarrama,Mathematics,"A students? choice of college major builds a foundation for their future career. One of the first decisions a student must make is a college math course, which is dependent on their choice of major. This researcher sought to provide insight into the choices students make about their first college math courses and college majors. The study population included students who had completed at least 45 credits at Central Washington University (CWU), in Ellensburg, WA. Data was collected using the on-line survey software Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). The survey collected responses about their high school and college courses as well as a, 4-factor Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory (ATMI) developed by Dr. Martha Tapia, an associate professor of mathematics at Berry College in Mount Berry, GA. The ATMI measures a students? enjoyment of math, self-confidence in math, motivation to do math, and perceived value of math. The results from this study showed a statistically significant relationship between the rigor of a students? last high school math course and their choice of a math dependent college major. The relationship between the grade students received in their last high school math courses and choosing a math-dependent college major was also statistically significant. The results of the ATMI showed that students who report a higher level of enjoyment of math, motivation to do math, and value for math were statistically more likely to choose majors that require math. Motivation to do math was the factor with the highest positive correlation with choosing a math dependent college major."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Technology Usage and Relationship Satisfaction,Michaela Rogers,Family and Consumer Sciences,"Technology has increasingly become a part of daily life, so it is important to identify how its use impacts relationships. Previous studies have found correlations between various types of technology use and relationship satisfaction. For instance, frequent cell phone use is associated with low relationship satisfaction (Coyne et al., 2011). Another study found that making the relationship ?official? on a Facebook profile is associated with high relationship satisfaction whereas talking about relationship disagreements on Facebook is associated with low relationship satisfaction (Papp et al., 2012). The current study adds to the existing literature by further examining the association between technology and relationship satisfaction, but by specifically examining technology use while with one?s romantic partner and perceptions of partners? technology use. The study involved collection of anonymous surveys from 124 participants between the ages of 18 and 45. Survey links were posted on social media sites. All participants were in romantic relationships during the study and responded to 21 questions about technology usage and relationship satisfaction. Results indicated no association between personal technology use and relationship satisfaction, however, there was a negative association between perceived partner technology use and relationship satisfaction, and between technology satisfaction and relationship satisfaction. Specifically, when participants perceived that their partner used technology often, they reported lower relationship satisfaction. Participants who reported satisfaction with their technology use tended to report high relationship satisfaction. The results suggest that perceptions and evaluations of technology use may be more important than actual use in predicting relationship satisfaction."

A sample of 268 adults completed a questionnaire online and in person that asked retrospective questions about their childhood experiences (age 4-17) in a hospital setting. The study assessed staff-to-patient communication and pediatric services (with many aspects specific to the Child Life profession) that minimized the impact of the pediatric environment. Results suggest that having a Child Life Specialist increases the child?s level of comfort, reduces fear and anxiety in pediatric patients, and reduces the level of trauma experienced by the child during their hospital experience.

Participants completed an anonymous online survey (N = 177). Results showed that some attitudes differed depending on maternal labor force participation. Children of mothers who were employed full time were more likely to endorse  statements in support of stay-at-home fathers and mothers participation in the workforce. Similarly, children of working mothers also endorsed that mothers should prioritize their participation in the labor force to the same degree that fathers do. Those whose mothers stayed home were more likely to agree to a statement in support of mothers taking as much time off work as they feel necessary. Findings suggest that maternal labor force participation may shape their child?s later views towards how men and women should divide work and family responsibilities."

Youth need positive, consistent relationships with caring adults to help them develop healthy behaviors in life. If the relationship does not happen naturally, mentoring programs can be employed to support youth by promoting positive youth outcomes. Having a better understanding of the differences in outcomes between mentored and non-mentored individuals is important in helping determine whether a mentoring program could be an option for Central Washington University. It was hypothesized that formal and non-formal mentoring affects most individuals positively and encourages youth to pursue success educationally and in their careers. A two page, self-administered, anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 39 CWU students regarding mentoring. Results showed that sixty percent of the participants in this study who had a mentor reported a higher GPA on average than their non-mentored counterparts. Results also indicate a positive correlation between having had a mentor and currently being employed full-time or part-time. Seventy percent of respondents who reported having had a mentor maintained full-time or part-time employment. A greater understanding of preventative measures that influence children positively is vital in impacting their lives. These results support the addition of youth mentoring programs by administrators faced with decision making regarding what type of programs to implement to improve outcomes for youth. These results may also assist with marketing efforts to recruit youth into existing mentorship programs. Further research should utilize a more diverse sample."

We explored gestures used in communication by captive Javan gibbons (Hylobates moloch) housed at the Gibbon Conservation Center (Santa Clarita, CA). We hypothesized that a sender gibbon?s gesture modality would vary with the recipient gibbon?s attentional state. We predicted that senders would be equally likely to use all gesture modalities (tactile, visual, actions, and facial expressions) when the recipient was attending (facing the sender) but would be biased toward tactile gestures and actions when the recipient was non-attending (oriented away from the sender). We collected data from three gibbon groups (N = 10 individuals) using all-occurrences sampling and an ethogram to score behaviors from digital video recordings. Occurrences of gestures through the four modalities were recorded during a gibbon?s attempt to interact with another group member. We observed 1,143 interactions over 20 days. When all data were aggregated, gibbons used visual gestures (t (18)=2.79, p=0.01) and facial expressions (t (18)=2.60, p=0.02) significantly more when the recipient was attending and tactile gestures (t (17)=2.47, p=0.02) significantly more when the recipient was non-attending. There was no significant difference in the actions modality (t (18)=0.82, p= 0.43). These data show that Javan gibbons used gestures that are appropriate to the recipient?s attentional state in three out of the four modalities."

Previous research has demonstrated higher amplitude P300 waveforms with shorter latencies of P300 onset in musician groups indicating a more sensitive and accurate stimulus detection system. Fluctuations of P300 amplitude and latency activity near parietal areas have been used to quantify differences in updating processes of working memory possibly associated with differences in amounts of music experience. The current study is designed to partially replicate a method previously implemented by George and Coch (2011) in order to contribute to the body of research describing how music experience may be associated with differences in visual processing as well as auditory working memory. Behavioral data will be collected using six standardized subtest measures of the TOMAL-2, followed by ERP recordings during a large and small circle visual oddball task. The current study hypothesizes musicians will score significantly higher on the TOMAL-2 and record shorter latency with higher P300 amplitudes associated with greater amounts of music experience in areas previously associated with working memory processing."

This body of research suggests music experience may be related to faster reaction times to auditory stimuli. In addition to reaction times recorded by clicking a mouse while listening to a tonal oddball, participants in the current study performed six subtests of the TOMAL-II, a standardized measure of working memory ability, documenting participants visual, auditory, and executive functioning modules of working memory. Our hypotheses are that means of performance on all three subtests of the TOMAL-II will be higher in the musician group compared to non-musicians, and musicians will on average record faster reaction times to various tonal difference conditions. Results of the current study will contribute to the understanding of differences in cognitive processing related to long-term music experience.

Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,An investigation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and rape myth acceptance scores,Danna  Waggoner,Psychology,"The purpose of this proposed study is to investigate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and later scores on a rape myth acceptance inventory. These scores are often used as a predictor of sexual aggression and will be used as such for this research. The study aims to further understand any relationships between childhood maltreatment and an individual?s sexual aggression seen here as rape myth acceptance. Second, is there a relationship between gender and the childhood maltreatment on rape myth acceptance? The hypothesis states that increased occurrences of childhood maltreatment will correlate with increased scores on the rape myth acceptance inventory. The understanding of a correlation between these variables can lead to better understanding of individuals who may benefit from sexual aggression prevention programs. The results of this study can also provide more information about the some of the side effects of child abuse and the long-term lasting effects. The instruments that will be used in this study are the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Inventory and the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) Study. This is a proposed study; no research has been collected at this time. "
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Understanding bullying: An analysis of current literature on bullying and prevention programs,Hunter  Olden,Psychology,"Bullying is an important issue in society today that impacts a large portion of the population. The topic of bullying is one that has been extensively researched over the past decade and it continues to be an important area of focus in the fields of education and psychology. With many different ways that bullying can manifest and the many contexts where is can occur, bullying has become an increasingly widespread problem. Bullying has been shown to have many negative physical and social consequences. The negative impacts of bullying have been associated with increased depression, anxiety, and higher rates of crime. As such, these negative outcomes involve factors within individuals as well as within the community. Due to the many factors at play and the complex nature of the problem, defining bullying in an accurate and reliable way can be challenging. To address all of these issues inherent to the problem, prevention programs have largely followed a social-ecological model. Programs that follow the social-ecological model focus on providing individuals with support by improving their individual skills as well as improving home and community environments. The purpose of this project is to present an analysis of the research currently available on the topic of bullying and on the prevention programs that aim at decreasing this increasingly prevalent problem."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,An Evaluation of Behavioral Skills Training to Teach Assertiveness Skills to College Students,Savannah Warrington,Psychology,"Assertiveness skills are related to a variety of life factors including stress levels, social relationships, social fears, and anxiety. The previous research has shown that engaging in nonassertive behavior can have negative effects, and assertive behaviors can lead to a healthier life (Eldeeb, Enstar, & Eldosoky, 2014; Elliot & Gramling, 1990; Morgan, 1974; Larijani, Aghajanie, Baheriraei, & Neiestanank, 2010). The purpose of the current research was to determine if behavioral skills training (BST) was effective in teaching assertiveness skills to college students and if the skills would generalize to novel situations. BST is a method for teaching skills that uses instructions, modeling, rehearsal and feedback. In the current study BST was used to identify and teach nine different assertive behaviors and help the participants differentiate between nonassertive, assertive, and aggressive behavior. The current study used a multiple baseline design to implement the BST intervention for three participants. It is expected that participants will show an increase in assertiveness skills, and that those skills will generalize to novel scenarios. "
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Effects of Marijuana Decriminalization on Youth,Nancy Ramirez Hernandez,Sociology,"Research suggests that physical and psychological health problems, as well as the inability to perform well academically and professionally can be attributed to marijuana use, especially when individuals start smoking and/or consuming at an early age. Cannabis is not a federally legal substance, thus no regulatory agency exists that assures marijuana and marijuana-laced products are efficient and safe for the public. The lack of this substance?s control has lead to the accidental consumption of marijuana edibles by children, which are a population of particular concern along with adolescents due to the drug?s greater negative effect on their developing brain. Another of opponents? fear is that use and crime will increment with legalization. Statistics, however, prove that these beliefs are erroneous. On the contrary, supporters agree that the legalization of marijuana will greatly benefit society, for example, by decreasing crime rates and allowing law enforcement officials to focus on protecting citizens from real dangers. This argument might be accurate. Studies show that in states where marijuana has been decriminalized, delinquency has declined. Although adults in four American states can legally use marijuana recreationally, the drug is far from being licit at the federal level. "

More specifically focusing on Washington, Oregon and Idaho. I will gather bicentennial census data to find evidence of racial population shifts in cities and towns where the population is over 10,000 people. The population change I will be looking for is a 50 percent reduction do to a dramatic or drastic event.  ?

Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,___ Lives Matter: Current Movements Against Police Brutality,Felicity Guerra,Sociology,"___ Lives Matter is a study on the social construction of public response to police brutality. Our research strives to provide an overview of the relationship between outrage over police brutality and activism. Specifically, our objective is to uncover the goals and ideologies of activist groups and organizations that emerged in response to recent events regarding police brutality in the age of social media. Our central question is why now? Why did these activist movements begin so strongly now in comparison to the 1990s, when police brutality was just as prevalent and highly publicized?  In addition, we want to determine the role of and type of resources available to these groups and the diversity (e.g. race/ethnicity, age, etc.) of the members and leaders involved. Our theory is that these movements spread from its point of origin via the increased level of communication through the use of advanced technology and social media, especially focusing on the role of personal video recording. In conducting this study, we will use internet searches via social media, websites, and news media stories in order to collect and uncover information about these activist groups and organizations. Specifically, we will examine these groups? goals, ideologies, and activism using a qualitative content analysis in order to construct a narrative around the social meanings behind why _____ lives matter."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,Newspaper Analysis: Impact of Immigration Raid in Rural Community ,Ana Alcala,Ethnic Studies; Academic Advising Center,"The purpose of this study was to review newspaper articles that referenced the immigration raid that occurred in Ellensburg WA. On January 20, 2011, Federal agents early Thursday morning (4:00am), arrested 14 Ellensburg area residents, 13 of them women, related to criminal charges of manufacture and purchase of counterfeit identity and employment documents. Content analysis was used to answer the ?What?? but not the ?Why?? questions. Thus, content analysis was used to describe, organize and summarize the content of the newspaper articles and its effects on the community. This Newspaper Analysis revealed the themes of the immigration raid as having strong impacts on the children of the families, the children of the local schools, and the children in the greater community.

Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Influence of Family Upbringing on the Facial Inference Process,Kara Pellegrini,Psychology,"This study examined personality trait inferences on the basis of facial expressions by showing participants multiple photographs of either one young female face or one young male face exhibiting three distinct facial expressions. Participants from two parent homes were asked to indicate which parent was more nurturing, and which parent enacted more disciplinary measures. Results demonstrated that responses to these two questions influenced participant trait responses to the ?angry? and ?sad? facial expressions. Results were discussed in terms of overall environmental influence on the inference causal attribution process."
Mar. 13th 2:30-5:00 p.m.,Ballroom B/C/D,The Relationship Between Gender and Perceived Stress Levels in College Students ,Meghan Gilbert,Psychology,"Previous research on stress in adults demonstrates that stress, even perceived stress, can take a toll on an individual?s health. Research also indicates that the severity of stress in college students has been rapidly increasing, which indicates a need for more investigation in this area. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference between the stress levels of male and female college students, and if so, whether there is another factor involved that can account for this difference. The participants consisted of students attending Brigham Young University who were also active members of The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints (152 women, 91 men) between the ages of 18 and 38 years (M=20.3, SD= 3.27). The participants were recruited through the SONA system and took an online survey. When participants were asked if the amount of stress they experienced was greater than they perceived other college students? stress to be, females were more likely to agree than males. Neither relationship status, nor having a ruminative explanatory style, could account for the difference. Implications of this research are discussed. "
